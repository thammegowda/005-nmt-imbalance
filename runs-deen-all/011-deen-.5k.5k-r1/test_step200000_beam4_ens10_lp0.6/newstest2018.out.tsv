Munich in 1856 : Four maps that change your view of the city	-9.1463
A mistake where young people are to be met today .	-11.2785
A tomb chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now digged .	-3.6686
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers .	-2.5499
The oldest official map in Munich promotes exciting stories .	-2.0815
It nerves if maps are not up to date .	-2.5870
This knows everyone who had to get up because the car navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-4.3555
The historical maps of the Bavarian digital atlas , an offer of the Bavarian Geoportal of the State Government , are far from topical - but this is precisely why very informative .	-4.9598
Especially if you compare them to current online cards .	-2.4019
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the distribution area of Munich Merkur .	-3.5884
The digital Bavarian atlas is a patchwork that you don 't recognize as such .	-11.0261
The large overview map included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so-called urposition leaves lililis listlilisted listed in listlistlililistlists listlinlistlisted in	-14.8341
According to the Bavarian Survey Administration , it was established between 1810 and 1864 and started from the first survey in Bavaria .	-5.1164
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.0037
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.0842
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-2.9290
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a covering Bavaria card .	-4.2350
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued the project , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian Survey Administration .	-3.4175
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian Library .	-3.7547
The comparison earlier / today is the most impressive example of the national capital .	-3.8510
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-2.2224
An example of this is subsendling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.1488
Sendling was involved 21 years after the creation of the map , in 1877 , as a district of Munich .	-3.6946
Today lies Untersendling in the heart of the city .	-2.3966
The Houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-7.2743
Where the West Park is today , you see nothing as fields - at first glance : a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears when zooming in : handwritten pieces of handwritten pieces from the so-called " premium " from which the base tax was derived .	-12.0563
Small plots no longer prove farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant " Land in Sun " .	-4.2533
A large green area is located north of Untersendling .	-2.8482
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-3.6899
On the other hand , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.1625
In the Urpositionsblatt you read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or " On the Auf der Lüften " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-5.0807
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e , people were once blocked with madness .	-4.0168
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle Irrenanstalt " On the Auer Luften " was born .	-13.3343
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-9.0230
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of so-called errors .	-2.8606
He also prohibited the staff to use violence against the passengers , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Haidhausen Museum , who dealt with an exhibition with the institution .	-4.2836
For 280 patients , space was first placed , later extended to 500 seats .	-4.7413
At some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circular institution in Hair 1905 .	-3.9072
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of the largest psychiatries in Germany , is located there .	-3.8990
On the area of the former Auer Institute , young people meet in the Munich Salesianum .	-4.2544
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies .	-15.0568
West lies the football court of the TSV Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s .	-3.7397
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built in architectural construction of the Irrenanstalt , which was destroyed during World War II during bombing .	-4.8240
Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as " Haupt Platz " , the Kaufingerstra<unk>e was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-3.2412
The Second World War also brought a significant change in the heart of Munich .	-2.8607
The bombs of the Allies caused many holes into the city centre in December 1944 .	-3.9899
A big one remained today - at the Marienhof .	-3.5156
The English Institute , small business houses and a medieval tomb chapel were once at the Marienhof , where these days the preparations and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn train track were carried out .	-5.8153
The slider allows you to compare the old Munich card with the air image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-3.8450
Civil Law Group Published Travel Awarning for Missouri	-2.3431
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State .	-3.4232
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls on African travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and extreme caution when travelling through the state , since a number of questionable , race-based incidents occur recently throughout the state and are noted here , " says the Group 's opinion .	-5.4160
A recent law of Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination actions , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , which are disproportionately aimed at minorities , led the group to issue the travel warning , said NAACP . lililililililililililililililililili	-11.7431
" They have violations of civil rights that people are happening .	-2.7379
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-2.8021
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . '	-2.1764
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .	-2.7263
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.3485
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during his journey through the state and was detained by the police of Missouri without being accused of crime .	-4.3728
The Council also highlights a recent report by the Missouri General Prosecutor 's Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 % more frequently than white .	-9.3003
" The recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.4738
'People must be willing to bring deposit money or let relatives know that they are travelling through the st? ????????????	-10.4144
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime report programme , which classify the state as regards the number of such injuries to the country ’ s 16th rank .	-4.3365
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-9.2217
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-3.9575
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .	-3.1470
Pasture Fence Project is Elemental	-7.8589
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-1.8587
The CDU MEPs Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac gave themselves an image on site .	-3.5708
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-3.6506
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his business where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.2571
The " Black Forest Milk " is for him the alternative-free marketing route for the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .	-3.4518
On the table of guests comes only regional .	-3.4873
As he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaun project " elementary important " .	-3.5976
I cannot manage profitably on such sharp areas .	-2.6673
The green land area ensures a lot of work , much needs to be handled with the engine sense .	-4.2005
" We have to fight with the conditions and with topography here , " said Schwendemann .	-2.9428
In 2003 he took over the parental company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not run a bio-farm .	-4.1368
For mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is glad about the leader promotion " .	-4.4526
At the cost of EUR 3 000 to EUR 4 000 per hectare , farmers should be supported .	-2.9375
One hopes that the reforestation of the surfaces could be drawn out for a while .	-4.6667
" The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business , " the mayor stressed .	-4.0046
Farmers are often in criticism for promoting them ? lilililistlililililistlilistlistlilistlinlistlistlilili	-10.8382
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced through the Weidezaunförderung .	-3.5581
The area of openness is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be forested by at least 2023 .	-3.2478
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was promoted through leaders , one quarter was the municipality of Fischerbach .	-4.3811
The farmers therefore remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence .	-3.3142
" The great advantage is the longevity of the fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.2539
Kordula Kovac emphasized : " You are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers it is not possible ' .	-4.0313
For Peter Wei<unk> , too , stood firm : " Best food is produced here " .	-4.3494
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg allows state promotion of fences .	-2.8849
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.9120
Prerequisite is the existence of a background described by the LPR .	-4.4368
Moreover , the fencing area must not be traffic manageable ( slopes over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-4.3121
For the 2018 Fischerbach Weidezaun project , eight participants are currently applying for 24 plots , which want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .	-4.2278
The area of openness corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-3.3410
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.9850
Now Trump ’ s White House Takes Freedom Statue	-2.7082
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-7.6312
The Americans value these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Firdo 's Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.7330
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologists , knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the statue of freedom .	-3.5524
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.6476
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have linked him if he had done so .	-2.9617
But he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-3.4762
When Miller Acosta said : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-3.5949
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom . liberty . '	-4.0890
Miller is quite right , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.2805
It is a question of contemporary response to the words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your fatigues , your poor , / Your afflicted masses who long for free breathing , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-5.5979
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " on our screens was better seen .	-2.7233
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-3.0649
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .	-2.9762
Lazarus - and her friends who worked to place their words on the basis after their death - knew very well that they took a high-political act .	-4.1204
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in an abused classic visual presentation .	-3.5935
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-2.9371
And she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the exiles livin.	-7.9490
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.3153
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .	-3.0351
The great shrine Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John of the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming , argued in 2010 that the statue of freedom is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the overnight world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-4.9012
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.3470
The torch should not enlighten the path to the United States ' .	-2.6888
Limbaugh encountered something quite unusual here .	-3.7002
The importance of the statue is a question of the position of perception .	-7.8783
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-3.3963
It is truly a question of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.1514
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.2755
And , of course , that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise .	-2.7530
Their torches should not enlighten the path , but lighten the hatred that is their only source of power .	-3.8718
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team	-16.1728
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team .	-12.3189
The United Kingdom ’ s Light Athletics Director , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish quota in the World Championship Championship Cadre will make a massive contribution to the team .	-4.4234
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.3070
Black believes that " something special develops in Scotland " and the UK 's light athletics must learn something from it .	-3.8480
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it , " said Black .	-2.3606
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.1677
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2375
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.1633
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.4374
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.9072
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team as a team captain .	-3.8610
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.1861
Your captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.1839
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-2.2055
The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally were great . '	-3.5821
The Commonwealth Silver Medal Winner , who will take place at the 400m-hurdles at her fifth World Championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.2212
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven who were reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-2.8562
The medium-haul runner Muir is heading along this road and has set up five British and two European records last year .	-4.4486
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-2.3847
Chris O 'Hare , which runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot that should be observed after a great season that included the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-3.8696
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in the team Lee McConnell .	-3.2521
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team , but in some cases also be part of the medals and finals .	-8.5593
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , it makes something very special for me , " she added .	-4.4876
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team .	-2.0899
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.5653
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podia .	-2.2819
As far as my speech as a captain is concera ?	-9.1890
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.2037
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championshi.	-10.9673
It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium .	-9.5386
I get a second chance to go beyond and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.6455
Block critics over Facebook : Don ’ t apply for a public office if you can ’ t heat voters	-11.3036
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.9553
The Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-2.6769
He screamed in criticism , safe .	-3.5155
But he did not silence his critics .	-1.3937
Because in 1783 , Washington said that ' freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led to battle like the sheep ' .	-4.1675
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washing.	-10.4505
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official facebook page .	-7.5663
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week .	-2.2956
The staff of the governor released the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-10.9368
" It is only Facebook " , said many people .	-1.8744
But it is important .	-0.7000
And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan .	-2.0922
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular .	-1.9744
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.1907
Hogan is not a reactionary head .	-1.1756
He has demonstrated a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principllies . lilililililililililili	-11.1643
He was also very skilled to use Facebook as a primary means of connecting to his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-3.0004
Therefore , blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is described as official and is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous by employees paid with public tax dollars .	-4.6091
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation .	-2.8511
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate the stick online .	-2.6714
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-1.8663
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll .	-3.0069
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .	-2.0141
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-2.3808
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked for hate crimes .	-1.8988
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news " , she wrote in the commentary area of the news show " The Post " .	-3.3055
" I do not appreciate this idea either , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some are disregarded rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens ' .	-5.2040
What the governor ’ s employees called “ concentrated spam attack ” would probably call others “ advocacy . ”	-3.7627
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-1.9934
It is much cleaner than in the past if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guide articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators ers . lilililililililili	-9.9955
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-1.9126
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for his abuse of Facebook and other social media .	-2.9197
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.8061
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-1.6488
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated First Amendment , according to US judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banished a voter from her facebook page .	-3.5512
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-12.2078
That should not be so difficult .	-1.6298
At the moment of Washington , the time of affordable ports had a similar effect as the Internet .	-3.4017
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters suggested his leadership .	-3.0714
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.5133
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-2.6756
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity , trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .	-3.2490
But he did not silence them .	-1.6484
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse form part of our nation .	-2.0802
And real leadership means accepting that .	-1.5992
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club	-1.6728
Former Europeans No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-3.2507

Less Passive Smoking Deaths	-2.6434
In the last two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-10.6681
The result is a study of scientists at the University Hospital in Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) .	-3.4615
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking every year , " said Heiko Becher studies manage .	-9.4657
He compared his own study on this subject from 1994 .	-3.2467
At that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths in Germany for passive smoking per year .	-2.9898

In her wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai Regent in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called " nota " - directly into the fireplace .	-3.9082
After half an hour , the carbon knoll is taken away with diligent , unwashed hands and swallowed .	-11.2118
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp .	-3.9581

It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was included in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders should vote by public hiding before the occupying forces .	-4.2848
An existing movement that stimulated independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers .	-3.5963
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea including the eastern part of the island .	-2.7073
Enarotali is as remote as it is tired ; the journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour rental car .	-5.1371

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.0377
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland .	-1.4514
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.0832
In 2015 alone , Freeport reduced $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.7000
Moreover , Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion .	-1.9986
These riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua who ensure that Indonesia ’ s powerful military preserves a stifling presence .	-3.0859
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost $ 20 million to local military members and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-7.6919

" The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , " explains Abeth You , a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura .	-3.3701
" It has cost the local Papua - the Mama [ the women ] of Papua - its market . '	-3.6682
During his campaign in 2014 , Indonesian President Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi in people , promised to tackle inequalities and infringements in Papua .	-3.9676
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-2.6280
But little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel cheated .	-2.7962
" Our hearts have broken because we voted in favour of Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-2.9949
In fact , only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration , Paniai suffered a low point in October .	-2.0613
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through darkness on a motorcycle .	-3.2870
The shocked children told them that they should turn on their headlights .	-2.6017
One of the soldiers took up their sound and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-3.5694
The soldiers who had drinked hunted and beat the group with their rifle pistons , said victims and witnesses .	-2.6378
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.7216
A child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was beaten so hard that he fell into coma .	-3.4629
A few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was fired and things escalated the next day .	-2.7141
About 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football place in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .	-3.0975
They presented ceremonial hunting arches and presented the Waita dance - continuously and imitating a bird singing - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe .	-4.2614
Some protesters began to slip stones on police and military posts .	-2.4743
When the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : " When the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead " , it says in an official document of TIME that was not released to the local media .	-4.2855
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for peace and called for the amount to return home .	-3.5645
Nobody was listening in the mood .	-1.7661
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .	-2.6136
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-2.9485
" It was crowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-2.2051
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times , including his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .	-3.4139
" I ran to him and investigated his body to be sure that he was , " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesians , wears only one name , the TIME in dark mood .	-3.8394
" I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . "	-1.4999
The chief spector of the Papua police , Yotje Mende , said reporters that his officers only wanted to " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-3.2472
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-2.1754
'It is about life and death . '	-1.8484
According to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and many others were injured .	-1.8339
The news about the killings came only the following day ' filtered ' to Jakarta .	-2.4442
Three weeks , Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua .	-3.7332
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-7.6615
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historic human rights violations .	-2.5753
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.3200
" Most injuries occurred long ago .	-1.5911
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s .	-1.6535
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements , but there are processes that must be undertaken , " he said .	-3.1439
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-10.0960
Instead , ' everything is governed by law ' , he said .	-2.1397
Wiranto , who accused the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , which called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor ’ s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been resolved in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-3.3229
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with grim incredibility .	-17.2790
" I have been interviewed four times in the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.4428
'I am tired . '	-1.4855
He says that he still lives in fear years later .	-2.0290
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.4824
" I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . "	-2.6689
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.2652
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .	-1.8117
" After I buried the corpses , the military was looking for me , " he says .	-2.9732
The shootings have not stopped .	-2.4396
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.4958
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.0931
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who had drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .	-2.8177
Exciting villagers protested before the company ’ s location office .	-2.5938
The police said that the villagers threw stones to officers responding by firing warning shots .	-10.1460
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot and killed one .	-9.2030
" We were so panic , we fear there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , according to the TIME .	-3.9187
'I have hidden myself in my house two days ' .	-2.5945
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the police ’ s mobile brigade from the area .	-3.2687
Paniai has always been an unrest for the Indonesian Government .	-2.3927
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal members Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-2.7290
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-2.8554
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.6491
In response , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years , on the pretext of ' securing national sovereignty ' .	-3.1272
Some never appear again .	-1.5649
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.0332
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction .	-1.3971
The rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.9453
Bread is just as exclusive .	-8.1231
People here grow everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-2.6278
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .	-3.0471
They retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.6543
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.6796
Over time , economic inequalities between domestic Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived larger since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport .	-3.3633
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better educated and prosperous migrants .	-2.7829
Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to manage their own companies competitively .	-3.1056
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , the chairman of the Paniai tribal council .	-13.7000
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.5521
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain tense .	-18.9230
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.1650
According to Phelim Kine , Human Rights Watch ’ s Deputy Asian Director , the promises of Jokowi ’ s election campaign to lift the reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development were not realized li.	-9.7945
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua : Visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-9.8939
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua .	-10.4879
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai shooting .	-3.3026
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.4298
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover evidence of human rights cases ' .	-3.9502
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.7720
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and afflicted him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting , but wanted to remain anonymous .	-3.7622
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote again for Yokowi .	-2.2807
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council .	-3.1293
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , besides living under the permanent threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-3.1643
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their voice for Yokowi as a " guilt " he must repay .	-3.3592
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-10.8126
Despite the threats and intimidation , families of the Paniai victims performed a last symbolic act of despite the fact that the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly to the police and the military station .	-4.5592
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .	-3.0868
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with lowered head .	-2.1251

Fire Capture the Torch skyscraper of Dubai for the second time	-2.7170
On Friday , in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , a fire found its book and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high , 79-floor building .	-4.3858
It is the second fire that swept through the high house in just two years , which is randomly called the torch tower ( torch to) . lilililililililililililili	-10.6877
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.3467
" We slept and we stood up with the fire alarm and crying the people .	-3.8163
We ran down the staircase and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , " a resident who indicated his name as George Reuters .	-3.6806
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4 a.m. local time ( 00.00 a.m. GMT ) deleted the fire and cooled the building .	-7.0064
The government said it was working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-2.8103
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of high-rise buildings around the world .	-3.3462
A study by the management of the Torch building following its fire in 2015 showed that the majority of the damage came from covering , external covering to decoration or isolation .	-4.4122
In the United Kingdom , the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and lining at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .	-4.5622
No Davis Cup Reform : Next Best of Five	-1.5909
The President of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-2.9221
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individuals only on two rates was thinly not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-15.8812
The five-sentence classics , which are often very long but also very valued , remain the traditional competition .	-5.1965
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of the reform , so ITF President David Haggerty ’ s target was therefore scarcely missed .	-4.1696
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-11.5402
We need a change to safeguard the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty . lilililililililililililililililili	-15.6632
We will continue to work to improve applications .	-2.1705
Not only did the vote , after many objections , come before the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place .	-4.0256
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the first round .	-4.1755
In order to reduce costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup .	-4.5218
More than 1 of 5 US travellers brings forbidden items to the aircraft , finds a survey . lililililililililililili	-10.0553
A survey among air passengers showed that more than 20 % were aware of or unconsciously banned items at the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points , including at least 6 % that entered the aircraft , while accidentally wearing banned knives or other items with blades .	-5.0725
Less than 1 % claimed that they had discovered late that they had travelled mistakenly with firearms , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.3318
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers rather disregarded the rules .	-4.1392
Of those respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % members of generation X.	-8.1778
The most common objects deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.0203
More than 3 % admitted to have knowingly borne items with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately banned drugs into the aircraft .	-4.3731
The company said it questioned travellers throughout the country to find out how many inadvertently brought smuggling through airport safety and how many would have done it deliberately .	-12.1484
It is no surprise that the people who wear the most smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly most frequently .	-3.8930
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.4956
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-8.6888
It is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of items confiscated by the TSA are prohibited fluids .	-11.8659
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling goods .	-2.8733
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.6070
Elon Musk does not care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers Cancel Order	-8.8362
Electro-thousand sassa Elon Musk is happy to indicate with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.5309
He has so far failed to suggest that part of the customer has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-4.2574
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla Chief Elon Musk , for the first time in announcing the recent quarterly balance sheet , has betrayed another , less glossy figure : that of cancellations in the new mass market model 3 .	-5.2270
Musk has often advertised in recent months with more than 500,000 preorders for the new car , whose extradition is just beginning .	-3.8700
Now Musk admits : Of the total 518,000 preorders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-12.3453
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-8.0622
In case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pound ) " Reservation Deposit " completely back .	-4.8484
Currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations were made , Musk granted a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.6610
However , the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 % of all orders could become a problem so far .	-3.6782
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production side .	-3.0056
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.3701
In 2018 , it will be 500,000 - all models together - 2020 million .	-3.4520
The demand for this is obviously there .	-8.9263
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are currently available per day .	-2.5086
Anyone who orders a " Model 3 " today can expect to deliver at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production roads , never tested in practice , without maximum interruptions with maximum utilization .	-5.3200
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4498
However , if there are major delays , the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-4.2778

EPA Chief Pruitt is withdrawing because of the delay in Obama Era rules to reduce emissions	-10.5361
One day after he was sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency , returned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of air pollutants caused by smog . lilimited liabillit.	-13.9814
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more reactive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.3494
He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a federal appeal court .	-3.4558
It is a deadline that took place on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-breaking ozone . , , , , in particul, , , , , , , , , , ,	-14.3706
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid ' interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth ' .	-3.3123
Pruitt , who was prosecutor of Oklahoma prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rules .	-3.1121
Since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry .	-2.9020
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.9194
Last month , a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-3.1624
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his reversal in ozone standards simply strengthens the EPO ’ s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in time .	-12.3269
" Under previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused by activist groups and others , and to set the date for implementation in an agreement , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.2146
" We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.3694
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously . '	-2.3543
Nevertheless , the EPO 's opinion said that at some point Pruitt will use his ' power to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are ' based on a solid policy and the best available information ' .	-4.5706
Congressional Republicans are pressing for a broader recast of ozone rules .	-2.5693
A bill approved last month will delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.4752
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.2591
The New York Public Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of the states that the EPA had sued this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.9032
" The reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-3.7620

The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .	-2.7119
Public health representatives and environmentalists cheered surprising change of course through Pruitt .	-3.3098
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe in , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.3568

Saving and maintaining the oldest building in the town has made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen their concern .	-3.7477
Walter Martini emphasizes : " It is a unique village lodge " .	-3.1523
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch : Graf Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-4.0978
According to the text of the certificate , the Tumlinger Mountain , apart from the former parish church , was also a dominant court , including the church or the patronage law , and not the other way round .	-5.4121
People lived there too .	-2.9653
As emerged from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858 , next to the lower village and the Oberdorf , which are currently still to be seen in the village of Tumlingen , was the " mountain " of the third , the dominant settlement centre of the village .	-12.3158
Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin these historical situations .	-12.5775
The patronage law was established in the early Middle Ages .	-3.9362
A Lord who built a church , equipped and occupied with a parish , remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .	-3.7573
The right to use a pastor or propose a new pastor to the bishop was associated with this .	-4.0685
Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.0648
The greater of the two crushed at Christmas 1673 .	-3.2343
The newly acquired bell then sounded for the first time in 1692 , but later had to be given in the Second World War in 1942 .	-4.0221
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were beaten and the bell ropes were stolen .	-3.5715
The roof was noisy .	-2.6909
In 1796 French troops stored near the church .	-1.9766
They broke out the punches and chairs and used them as burning wood .	-3.3184
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-1.8779
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler .	-3.3731
In 1823 the graveyard was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was aborted .	-3.2048
Only the church tower was let stand .	-2.9624
In New Year 's Night 1834 , a storm divided the church tower and half collapsed .	-3.1650
To prevent an accident , the tower was cancelled .	-2.7273
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today has been preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-11.2061
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivate the Hilarius plant from the " Schaffigen Rentners " as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn .	-3.5585
As an organizer , the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery on Sunday , July 16 .	-4.4818
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-2.9643
Local director Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-2.9973
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.9038
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.	-7.2338
A transformation takes place in front of the graveyard to the end of the Serenade .	-3.9392
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest " , the organisers show the fantastic view .	-4.5027
The serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-1.9618
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for tumlingen and listeners .	-4.2676
Friends and conveyors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms .	-3.7531
Association wants to have wind wheel authorisation checked	-4.0264
" Boisheim defends itself " does not see any legal condition for construction and has therefore turned to the country council .	-3.9146
The association " Boisheim resists " has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its authorisation for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.9188
It has been illegal .	-1.8280
The Association argues that at the time of authorisation on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved , since at the time in fourses only a wind concentration zone existed at the border with Schwalmtal .	-5.6956
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the city .	-4.8212
These areas should prevent " savings " of the landscape .	-3.4572
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette just a few days earlier by changing the land use plan , the Düsseldorf district government had not approved because of a form error .	-5.0731
" Because of the lack of planning requirements , the authorisation declaration given remains illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim resists " .	-10.6653
Current state of affairs : Before the summer break , the City Council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; an approval of the district government is still out .	-5.2095
Erkens : " This excludes the granting of authorisation for the establishment of wind power plants planning law here " .	-5.2033
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.5601
" The corresponding letters have entered the circle of quadruples since last week , " said a spokeslist .	-10.7070
The circle takes them to re-examine the matter .	-2.4732
However , they do not expect to stop the procedure .	-3.0669
With a view to current proceedings at the administrative court , the circle did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association " Boisheim defends itself " on Thursday .	-4.5106
NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 metres high wind wheels on an area at the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.8277
Already last year , the company in which the city of Viersen is involved had concluded leasing contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large terground part of the company under the limof participlilimits .	-16.9682
With the establishment of the four wind power plants , the electricity requirements of approximately 11 400 households are to be met - around one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four-sen households .	-5.1042
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.7348
Last summer , Foursen ’ s City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich Wind Park near Aachen , as well as participation in a wind turbines in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district .	-4.7330
Auto and Traktor collapsed : Women die in the event of terrible accidents	-14.3547
A terrible road accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel ( Rhine-Lahn-Kreis ) .	-2.9765

City and Dealers Plan Home Shopping Weekend	-3.4011
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.4242
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .	-4.2682
As the Chairman of the Industrial Association , Christian König , announced , the " Heimat Shopping " weekend will raise customers ' awareness of what offers their own city offers outside the usual supermarket goods .	-5.4458
Therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .	-2.9988
Furthermore , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places .	-3.5666
In addition , the shops of the city centre are to be invited to " midnight shopping " .	-4.5510
The action aims not only to inhabitants of the city and the closer region .	-3.9721
In preparation are advertising spots in the radio , an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , according to Christian King .	-3.2632
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .	-3.0261
Thus the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project " Attractive City Centre " .	-4.1112
These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Well Festival and Sunday , discussions with all traders and hosts to actively participate .	-4.7770
Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees this day are also part of the concept .	-3.7481
In addition , customer potential should be re-opened or re-opened .	-3.4618
They include spa guests and tourists .	-10.6314
But many locals would have lost the city centre when shopping .	-4.1566
In the end , everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - to landlords , the companies of the whole city and clubs .	-5.2765
It applies to overcome the lethargy with a network , which has partly become widespread , King said in the sprin.	-5.6569
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK Centre in Mühlhausen announced that the third " home shopping " day , first participated in five Thuringian cities .	-4.1972
Besides Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-2.8597
The day should ' promote the value of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common good of our cities ' , says Streich .	-4.3417
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment with his buying behaviour .	-4.1424

Trump put under pressure for Mexico ’ s payment of the border wall after leaked transcripts of telephone calls .	-3.7574
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.0389
On January 27 , Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.8293
The US president abused him because he had publicly denounced the wall , according to which he said to him : ' You cannot say that to the press ' .	-4.6750
Trump launched his presidential campaign promising to build a wall on the US southern border , and swore to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.3468
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.2965
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US emigrating refugees to Australia is " ridiculous " , " mies " and " stupid " , and that the existence of trade conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a " Depp " after proposing a ban on relocation of refugees to the US .	-12.8938
Mr. Trump finished the call after he had said to Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' . ...	-10.6485
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists resume racist lynchact as a call for justice	-2.8652
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumbled to the Ford bridge of Moore .	-3.9882
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way .	-2.8649
The leader of the mob - a middle-age man in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked testing through the windscreen .	-3.9627
Inside , the passengers were fearful .	-8.3108
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " the man rolled .	-2.9771
'Get it out of the car ! '	-2.0205
Cries torn the silence when a young black man was crushed by the front-passenger seat .	-2.9695
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only one position .	-3.1017
But if a sling is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience looked very real sighs out .	-10.0968
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were gelynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-8.7490
Nobody has ever been accused of killing .	-2.2735
" It is really inconceivable that no single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organize the employment .	-4.3027
" It is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.8495
Brooks is a 71-year-old Georgian congressmen and a lifelong civil rights activist .	-3.6693
It serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.4623
" We want law enforcement , we want ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , " he said .	-2.7571
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.3657
A court medical officer puts a bed sheet over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynches on July 27 , 1946 .	-9.6775
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.8956
But no one has ever been charged .	-2.3841
Although suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights advocates say that the dual motivation for lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-3.5677
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court decision allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer .	-3.1154
About the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmpower Roger Malcom stood a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a battle - supposedly because of a woman .	-4.4103
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy , and that the baby she carried did not come from her husband .	-3.4777
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to liberate Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.8069
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-1.7416
But when they removed from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-2.6901
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-3.0828
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , removed evidence and covered the identity of witnesses " .	-3.6098
Brooks formulates it even more concise .	-2.4253
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.8288
'You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you let yourself be registered and if you vote , then that will happen here . '	-3.8504
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual replacement of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-2.9590
Their presentation is vivid , grasping , and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that it no longer exists in America .	-4.4663
It is difficult to watch and look even more difficult away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.1491
" We do not want to talk about lynching , because then we are faced with its uglity in all of us , " she said .	-3.5144
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-3.1920
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pushed into a room and listened when Greene launched a well recorded overview of the piece .	-3.8721
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co director .	-7.8003
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-2.7936
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.6576
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times . "	-3.1125
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.4575
The piece begins with Malcom , who starts and afflicts Hester , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-3.8583
'I said n --- he , disappears from my property ! '	-1.9437
Rascona replies the fire .	-1.9492
There is a break .	-0.7917
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .	-2.1631
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.6432
" What ? ! " , asked Rascona .	-1.7540
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.0230
Was I too hard ?	-1.0127
" No " , Greene said , still kichernd .	-2.8975
" I simply do not believe that white people then said ' n --- he ' .	-3.2009
" But " , one of the other black actors joked .	-2.5036
" You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-2.2377
And this is exactly where energy is shifting in the room , a feeling of comradeship replaces the unease .	-4.1216
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .	-2.6731
The scene begins again .	-1.4399
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and emphatically .	-2.5600
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.4743
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.4699
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.4523
A woman dressed with a mourning dress stands over the corpses of the actors and executes Billie Holidays mourning praise " Strange Fruit " .	-4.5772
Your voice breaks every second word .	-2.1033
About a hundred metres behind this , a group of about four dozen spectators wipes out of the eyes sweat and tears .	-4.8131
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.6134
A couple has travelled from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many only come down the street .	-2.7717
They have experienced Georgia ’ s pressing moisture every nearly eight hours when Brooks lead them to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage trip .	-4.2003
Until this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels spectacular .	-3.9439
When the last notes of the song finish , Greene invites you to come closer and inspect the corpse .	-9.4480
Children stick to their heads , register the counterfeit blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other .	-3.1627
" They are not really dead " , a small boy murmurs as if he wants to remember .	-3.1234
After a few minutes Greene thanks the quantity - and suddenly it is over .	-2.4594
The actors discard the lynchrope and wipe off their tears .	-3.2475
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .	-2.4653
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then cruelly collapses in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him .	-4.2213
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-1.5900
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.5515
You did so for one reason . '	-2.0266
Later , the audience meets the actors for dinner .	-2.8006
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta chatting about the position with a black couple that they have just met .	-4.5760
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance .	-2.4873
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and actions ... come from people who look like you yourself and who do so because they look like you , " she said .	-9.0635
'What this really does with me lets me believe that the lynche is still going on ' , she added , ' today it is only called police shooting ' .	-5.0261
In the same space Tyrone Brooks Hof keeps his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights .	-3.1439
He said he started planning the performance next year .	-2.1039
" The employment is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horrors of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.7231
" It is so if we do not learn anything from it , then it can happen again .	-3.4816
Whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . '	-3.0100

Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful frivolous staging of a gigantic , six-floor backdrop .	-4.4423

There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which is showing itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat again in leisure clothing .	-5.0947
The performance of Frank Castorf and his director team was expected with tension .	-4.0339
Had he still had to get a regular pipe concert over himself in 2013 , there were five years later great jubles in which the individual " bow " calls were subjected .	-6.6677
Festival head of Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this .	-4.2331
" You notice that the audience grew together with the " ring " in some way , " she said just before the performance of the dpa .	-4.0799
Not only did the audience make a form of peace with Castorf , but it was also an understanding of its view .	-3.8042

The Taliban said they had executed this attack .	-1.8613
On May 31 , a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s most deadly militant attack since the US-led troops displaced the Taliban from power in 2001 .	-3.7624
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Trump weighs up increasing the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country .	-2.9375
Correspondents say that in recent weeks , the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani .	-3.3953
EPA reverses decision to delay the smog rule after complains	-3.9957
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration that states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions , which took place a day after 15 states sued the agency for the stepli.	-14.7338
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive forward the so-called ' ozone regulations in 2015 ' and said that it shows the Agency 's obligation to work with states .	-9.0175
" We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , " said EPA-Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.2813
In June , Pruitt announced the EPO 's intention to delay the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018 .	-4.6041
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , submitted complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-12.3795
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a broad range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump wants to boost economic growth .	-3.1671
However , the efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature protection groups , which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-3.5287
The EPA website says that breathing air containing ozone " can reduce lung function and strengthen breathing symptoms " such as asthma .	-3.5014
Council of Municipalities wants Community are?e	-14.0034
In the end , the decision was clear : in two opposite votes , the municipality of Fluorn coins decides to establish a Community area in the future senior residential complex under a list .	-13.7688
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the lack of land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-3.6132
Although it will take until the parish community has been owned to date , there is no longer any obstacle to planning for the project to be stamped by a private investor .	-5.9674
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-3.0329
One of the two investors who are still on board has offered to accommodate the community .	-2.8711
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters surface for a special price .	-4.2248
The administration and the majority of the Council of Municipalities propose that such a Community area should not be provided as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of senior residence , but openly into the community .	-4.9898
As an example , the word " knitting café " made the round .	-2.9776
The decision that was already sweetened last autumn by the allocation of funds to the current budget will be subsidised .	-5.1569
Construction is located in the refurbishment area .	-9.8728
The establishment of a Community area , as Tjaden reports , would be eligible for 60 percent .	-4.3490
The proposal for a resolution to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw him a link between his legs in this respect , stating that both saddle - which is referred to the environment - and pult roof - which reduces the level of grape and makes construction more economical - would be possible .	-6.8933
Unnecessary , not only does Wilfried Sohmer think , is this addition .	-7.5238
If it helps : unanimously , it will happen to the body .	-3.1017
The Community area is not as easy as that .	-8.8876
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings with which one does not make such progress , for which one is now opposed to the Community area from the window , she says : ' I am hard to do it ' .	-6.8397
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area , but absolutely opposed to local participation .	-2.9291
It sees behind this a hidden subsidy to wealthy or even foreign investors .	-3.9106
That is not the case , because the acquisition of the area does not give grants , but gets a genuine value marketable in case of doubt , the counter-talk is .	-6.0788
Staiger ’ s request to split up the decision proposal accordingly finds three supporters .	-4.0468
Thus , two votes against the original programme , which summarises Stefan Haller : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-4.3323

The supercup takes place without him : David Alaba must let the game saw against Dortmund .	-3.0796
With personnel care , the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first duty game of the new season .	-3.6763
Seven professionals lack the title defender in the supercup against the pocal winner .	-2.7798
Personnel care at the German football record master Bayern München is increasingly growing before the supercup on Saturday ( 20.30 a.m. / ZDF and Eurosport ) at Pocal Winner Borussia Dortmund .	-4.6687
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also abandon David Alaba in duel with the BVB .	-3.1091
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .	-1.6945
Munich also lacks Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat .	-2.4771
For the five defeats in the past six test games , Ancelotti has made the physical state and the lack of balance in the game of his team responsible .	-3.6740
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-2.1298
Last but not least , that was not good . '	-2.2196
The 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season .	-3.2681
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.3055
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-1.8143
The team is ready .	-0.8101
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intensive game " .	-2.0329
The duel of the two German football heavy weights pulls the fans into their current life .	-12.0397

Hiking from Star to Star Resin	-2.6626
In resin the first " star path " is to emerge in Germany .	-4.7551
The association is planning this association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-3.7613
There is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.5053
A " star path " meets the need for information from many resin visitors , it was said .	-3.9810
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-1.9580
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and then inform them about stars and constellations s .	-8.5342
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans " well-reachable installations in five to six locations " in the upper resin .	-3.6814
The question would be St. Andreasberg , Brown Location , Hohegei<unk> and Sieber .	-4.0392
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet .	-3.0600
Therefore , a good mobile reception plays a role in the selection of locations .	-3.7727
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.2213
Later , the Starpath Trail was to be extended by train .	-4.0698
" On the starry path the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-4.6901
They also learned why stars have different colors or why a star shines more than another , although it is much further away .	-4.2149
It also mediates the constellation in which a selected star is located and when it is best to se.	-4.6981
Since 2014 , the association has operated the highest star waiting in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-3.9323
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection , the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.6049
From there , the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy are often clear .	-3.8152
Since 2003 , the Planetarium Göttingen Association has had something similar to the planned Starnenwerg - the Planetenweg .	-12.2450
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planettenweg with its steles leads up to Hainberg and to the star wait - as well as a " alien " location in Diemarden ( municipality of Gleichen ) with the planet Sedna .	-4.8628
The stels with the individual planets - including the pluto at the end point degraded to the dwarf planet - are situated exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-4.4010
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the exactly 75 metres away sun measures 70 centimetres .	-3.9113
The entire distance of the planet trail is about four kilometres .	-3.2734
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto .	-2.8385
So pedestrians are faster than light in the world .	-2.4157
The march to the next fix star , however , would take half a year .	-8.9656
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-1.6579
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .	-3.2542
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Weight Champion weweweweweiweight weweweideas .	-12.1174
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former Four Divisions World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five pound-for pound list .	-3.4673
Garcia stretched the right hand out and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-2.5569
I wish you luck . "	-6.4874
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN .	-1.9906
When the pair posed for photos , Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect magnitude " .	-2.9251
" I am a former spring weight , " reminded Garcia .	-2.1133
" I got up for broners [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-2.9303
I am small for 140 .	-0.8796
I would like to go down to light weight .	-3.1549
And he must move on lightweights [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.9094
That is what the fans demand .	-2.0061
Let us give them that . '	-1.5899
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.7713
" Boxes need this fight . "	-6.8448
Climas asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) that also has interest in combating the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell following their lightweight title struggle in the forum on 23 September .	-4.5042
" This struggle could take place in pay-per-view mode , because all fans asked for him , " said Garcia and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .	-4.0633
We are the best .	-0.6799
No other names can generate this type of attention .	-1.7942
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.1968
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " , and he may participate in his Saturday battle .	-8.0657
But Lomachenko stopped with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the three-combat champion from Riverside look " very slow , sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-3.8907
Garcia said that the focus is to show strength , then boxes .	-2.2534
Both said that they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .	-3.0578
" This is the fight that needs to be carried out .	-2.4258
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-1.6795
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.6793
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-1.6165
It will be a great fight . '	-1.6168
Four Injured by Tyre Square	-2.2412
Four people were partly seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon .	-3.1354
After first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the connection point market width probably after a tyre place .	-4.8677
The car slipped to the right into the bush where he fell over and then remained on the roof in the green strip .	-5.9115
The four passengers - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident .	-2.3360
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked north for about one hour , and then the traffic on the left could be passed by at the accident point .	-5.3077
Fortunas Hoffmann : " Triple Chain works better "	-1.6962
Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense formation will bring points to light after the 2 : 2 season opening against Braunschweig .	-4.2509
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , with the result too , would not have been the two counterparts against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 .	-8.8595
" These were two counter-doors too much , and we need to take even better care in Aue , " says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-4.3989
The Triple Chain is to be optimized further in the Erzgebirge e e les e e les .	-13.3152
And a gateway after a free shot does not want to capture the Fortunes .	-5.6221
" For the future it will be that nobody else , alongside Michael ( Rensing ) , will be on the line . "	-6.2464
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparing for the tripartite chain , his team is better off than with the four-chain .	-4.7929
" I do not know how we are going to act in audience , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have players in the tripartite chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.5508
" The condition is that we harmonise even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in the construcsector !	-14.5097
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game .	-2.9195
" But whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw , doesn 't know . ? .....	-10.8508
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-2.4841
" However , if we can stand with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal start . "	-4.7269
His trainer did not want to know anything about this .	-2.7181
" I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of playing , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to talk about an advantage over the eye just because the game of the Saxonies in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm .	-5.0076
" Now you can start the season almost with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be somewhat fresher because they do not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones .	-4.9090
" But they do not know as much as 100 % where they are at present , " says the internal defender of Fortuna .	-3.7381
Although guests from the Rhineland , as a light favorite on Sunday , go to the meeting in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-4.3034
" That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is bloodless , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive with only one defeat against eye from nine games .	-5.3506
" There is no team in the second Bundesliga , which must be beaten from the outset , " explains Fortunas Chefcoach .	-3.7752
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and lightweight .	-8.7905
And so Funkel doesn ’ t want to experience his players on Sunday .	-8.7688
New Results of Swedish Asylum Review Tests	-8.5366
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden undergoing a new method of medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 % of the tested persons are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.0454
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine ( Rättsmedicinal Verket ) started carrying out tests last year .	-3.2193
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Migration Agency ) was criticized for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-4.3084
To date , migration verket sent 6,880 cases to test and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31st , 2017 .	-4.0860
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-2.7466
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person was " possibly under the age of 18 " .	-2.5720
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-2.4799
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results of the past few months are constant .	-9.3751
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.1215
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-3.1280
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that ' propose that the investigated person be 18 years or older ' .	-2.7512
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results published , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said she would be 18 years old this year .	-3.5373
The method of medical retirement assessment , where X-ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints , then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-4.0413
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went sooner or later than usual through puberty .	-3.1413
" I had reason to think about this and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.5874
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.3105
If we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , " he said to the newspaper Metro .	-2.8960
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as adults is low .	-11.1182
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 % . '	-4.1929
Full in the Plan	-1.3636
The work on the three bridges of Landstra<unk>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.7281
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.9687
" We are very good at the time , it is running super , " says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the department road and traffic in the government board Freiburg .	-9.2997
In April , the work began at the same time on all three bridges needed to reconstruct between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-14.0242
The building end is scheduled for October and it is easy for the timetable to be respected .	-4.1305
The first bridge coming from Schramberg leads over the Trombach .	-2.4585
It is a vaulted arc bridge made of concrete covered with red coloured stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-4.0539
It was built in 1900 .	-1.1912
Like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .	-2.3314
To ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly restored .	-3.6781
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach .	-2.0821
They are made of red colourful stone .	-2.4909
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.60 meters long .	-2.1979
The bridge at the entrance to the village of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .	-4.0335
This is a peripheral fortification which is also used as an operating route .	-4.5904
On the southern part of the bridge , a 2.20 metre bridge cap will be used on Friday .	-3.5587
That is what the pedestrian path should be .	-4.1832
The particular reason is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-8.4824
The other two bridges are already patented with the bridge caps .	-2.5361
Special fingertips required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach .	-4.0758
There is also a glass fibre cable to which many companies are connected .	-3.5387
The inhabitants were informed about the project in the run-up to the work by hand lists .	-4.6809
In addition , fish and cancer had to be fished .	-2.5738
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the collection whoever towards Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-4.4875
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " is fully locked .	-4.0655
The cost of the three bridge repairs amounts to EUR 700 000 .	-3.1601
It is funded by the country .	-2.3644
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter protea Gerlilittle li!	-10.2519
It does not happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , it is difficult to reconcile .	-14.2050
The parties represented in the Kreistag Volcaneifel ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag this day , because the AfD invites the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster " Great campaign opening " .	-5.4563

The motto " The Eifel remains colourful " .	-1.8982
Originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto " All at a table " on the Well Square , but now takes place in the car park below the rondel - directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-4.7474
A colourful picture .	-2.6223
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the Forums A World and one of the relevant organizers , rightly rejoices : " Toll how many people have met here " .	-4.4259
There are music and lots of food , including a " German potato salad that the AfD could eat without problems " , says the woman who brought him with him .	-4.1296
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .	-4.7645
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-2.2999
Mario Hompes reported about the AfD Volcaneifel , he tried to make such an event and received the supplement .	-4.6049
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for a cancellation in Daun , because there are not enough parking spaces because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes .	-5.1967
So now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-13.3195
With a view to the event on the rondola show , he says : " This is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-5.0099
That is what it is doing : at 8 p.m. on the rondel square , a band provides entertainment , in the city hall various speakers , including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge .	-6.0375
In the Chamber there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and Deputy Chairman Beatrix von Storch to hold their speeches .	-4.0581
The police presence is unchanged , but so far officials have had a quiet evening .	-2.6377
A little over an hour lasts the AfD event , the guests on the front place have a longer breath , but there too is scheduled to clean up shortly after 21 a.m.	-12.4677

Coe praises " honest " Russian apology for doping scandals	-12.2036
The global leader of light athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be back into sport .	-3.9048
Russia ’ s light athletic chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Light Athletics World Championships that his country ’ s exile was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-4.0143
He said that he was sorry for " all athletes who were snapped away from gold and silver medals in competitions " .	-3.4755
Despite its comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found references to state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.0143
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.3476
" The whole Council and the whole of Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . "	-4.4032
Coe said he was also " pleased " that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction .	-2.4711
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the time to restore Russia , " said Coe .	-2.7146
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation .	-2.2321
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the spoilt system , " he added .	-2.7229

Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election	-2.3616
CDU and FDP Before Possible Majority in Lower Saxony	-2.0524
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country ’ s day , but he does not want to resign .	-3.2515
Because , on Friday , it advocated the dissolution of Parliament .	-3.0911
Previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Member from her group in Lower Saxony plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.3858
Five months before the official date of the country election , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition of CDU and FDP .	-3.4017
The previous Green Member , Elke Twesten , justified her step with non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-4.1257
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-1.9846
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to accept them .	-2.9554
Thus , CDU and FDP would have 69 seats together in Lower Saxon , SPD and Green .	-3.8144
So far the relationship has been the other way round .	-7.6752
The new country day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-9.5624
Thumler said that the red-green national government must now decide whether to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.1884
Stephan Weil , however , considers it essential that the country day decides its self-resolution as soon as possible .	-3.3444
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday what to do .	-2.8652
The national constitution also provides for the possibility of the Prime Minister removing confidence and electing a successor .	-3.6390
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.3842
These possibilities must be examined legally cleanly , " said Thümler .	-3.2889
'All questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally reasonably examined ' .	-4.4642
Thümler called Twesten 's step " yet something curious " .	-3.1242
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.0137
I feel very good " .	-1.4543
She called herself a supporter of black green .	-2.6979
The Greens called on the breakaway Members to return their country mandate .	-3.2043
" We assume , of course , that she returns her country mandate , which she has received through the green national list , with immediate effect , " said the national chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Kletter listed .	-14.8353
The Chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Anja Piel , said : ' We extremely regret the decision taken by Elke Twesten ' .	-3.2974
You deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group .	-2.2937
'Against the background that there were no substantive differences , we cannot understand this step ' .	-3.2166
SPD Chancellor Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transgression of Lower Saxon Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal .	-3.6022
" The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate , but also betrayal of red green , " the Federal Head of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook .	-4.0113
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re-elect the country day quickly .	-3.0636
Twest ’ s withdrawal costs the majority of red green in Lower Saxony .	-2.6181
The politician places " in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests in the country 's well-being " , criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-4.0388
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to beat political capital from it " .	-3.6005
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU leader , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend his MEPs to include Elke Twest in the CDU .	-8.1255
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of distorting the outcome of the 2013 election with personal career remembrance .	-4.1964

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic parties , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.8574
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.3180
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.4269
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.1293
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) speaks and answers with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-2.5398
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.5371
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp impression .	-3.1544
On the consumer protection portal www.food warning.de , the federal states will provide the latest information on the egg charges concerned .	-4.5250
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-1.4903
Even if , after everything we know at the moment , a health threat is virtually excluded .	-3.4617
Does Aldi now take on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of offer - because the central role of the Enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture ?	-3.8332
Food surveillance is the task of the federal states .	-2.1689
Nevertheless , my House has opened up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since Germany became known .	-4.3600
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.9477
Like manufacturers , trade must ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe to health .	-3.4333
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are not traffic effective .	-11.0750
However , unburdened eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.1797
This time the companies are not to blame .	-3.1864
Seat production factories and consumers in the same boat ?	-2.6229
According to the current level of knowledge , the production companies are not directly responsible for the imof lililililililili	-11.1122
Instead , they must expect economic damage due to illegal practices by service companies .	-3.1974
As always , there are too few controllers in serious cases .	-2.4979
Is there only a lack of staff or of coherent competence ?	-3.3494
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.4772
However , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be excluded 100 % .	-13.6670
It is precisely for this reason that consistent information on such events and the handover to prosecutors in the cases where crimes may exist is crucial .	-5.0894
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the responsible authorities .	-2.7752
Is regular alarmism really necessary for food scandals ?	-2.3246
Consumers have the right to get only safe and transportable food .	-2.4417
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.6446
The flushed resources have put manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-12.8988
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the Fipronil insecticide in the attitude of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately .	-3.7393
This must be worked on at all levels consistently and with high pressure .	-3.2744
I expect all the competent authorities to rapidly and completely clarify the matter .	-3.5371
How Financial Rules of Football Move to Paris	-8.0561
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spain ’ s Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.3416
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-3.7751
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses .	-3.9354
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to purchase the Brazilian from his treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will be $ 10 million per year .	-10.2223
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France .	-1.6343
PSG can certainly loosen the money to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy-rich family of Qatar .	-11.0142
Associations may spend a lot of money on purchasing players , but must control with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the Break-Even point in their football business .	-4.4218
FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election as UEFA President in 2007 .	-1.9974
Former French players believed that clubs that had taken enormous debt in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-9.9345
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.4461
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter .	-3.4170
During the current three-year FFP event period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-2.6898
And , although Platini fell into disgrace by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to deterring excessive spending .	-11.9792
" Surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , compared to The Associated Press last week .	-3.2211
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .	-3.3213
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the replacement amount for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be recorded in the annual accounts .	-4.1199
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 met the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .	-10.8345
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014-15 Champions League will remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .	-4.0370
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by bloating their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club .	-3.7585
While a Catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income .	-3.4411
This is what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.7322
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments by the World Cup 2022 organization committee .	-3.9171
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 disputed that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and that such a manoeuvre could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators .	-3.7389
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to respect any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.9442
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar ’ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-7.5085
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.8479
The latest reports published show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with sales of EUR 542.4 million , has earned more than EUR 10 million .	-9.3085
Accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .	-10.0900
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing to sponsoring deals , merchandising , and trikot sales .	-2.4862
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-17.8592
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.4183
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state " , said the President of La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish newspaper AS regarding Qatar 's ultimate ownership to PSG .	-3.0206
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .	-2.8127
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.9181
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-2.0130
It is going to be very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because different ways can be taken or different interests may have if a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.5568
Swiss Looking for a New Schoggi Supplier	-2.5076
In recent years , Chocolat Frey Bord chocolate has produced for Swiss .	-2.6922
Now , sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline rewrites the order .	-3.5852
Swiss-speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request from the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper " Northwestern Switzerland " of Friday .	-3.4056
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.1846
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-2.6100
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.1234
Around 17 million small red white packed shoggitables to 14 grams per year distribute the flight companions before landing to passengers .	-4.4286
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs .	-7.0762
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million Francs - the migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion francs .	-3.8855
But more important is the advertising effect : for a Schoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious order .	-3.3787
The Swiss does not want to betray the number of applicants in the new tender .	-4.2003
Only Swiss manufacturers are in question .	-2.5484
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey seeks to renew the contract beyond the spring of life 201.	-10.9812
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.7715
Chocolate boards have been distributing Swiss on board their flights since 2006 .	-3.1090
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug .	-2.7011
The possibility of placing the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-2.4690
The airline works together with various Swiss chocolate producers livin.	-9.4668
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are pampered with delicacies by the Confiserie Sprüngli , in the Business Class passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey .	-3.8662
Swiss Schoggi also distributes Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey , both in the business and seconomy .	-14.8155

Nostalgia goes to the niche in " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-2.2211
This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80s , for the 90-year-old ground era ( when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things .	-4.6476
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and an embodiment of our facebook-capable era of permanent memories .	-2.6158
But as a franchise it feels like time is short .	-2.5016
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-2.7694
By stifling at the heart of the gag - actors of middle ages play horny children who will grow up - they still managed to get the last part of the joke back .	-5.8136
" Ten Years Later " , with its adults who are now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting principle , including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that swings the cradle " ) .	-8.0521
At one point a character breaks through an Apple powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.3795
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.1127
The loving coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.8364
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.9205
And there is another crazy malicious plot in which Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Showalter ) is involved , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-10.4841
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-2.2772
It is particularly fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's sub-lip bart of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-4.5593
They are the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeating " Seven Up ! " series until he achieves what I consider to be his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-4.2561
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its east-west ring struggle iconography .	-4.0058
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as as director indicates that he is a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism .	-4.0189
The main roles - a hard-sorted gregor and an idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogs are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-3.3100
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.1039
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.3194
There are some beautiful gags to reputation ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-3.3825
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find the Voice ' .	-2.5131
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.1191
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-3.1719
" Comrade Detective " , edited to a lower length , could better deliver its agitprop satire , because Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devoured a cluster of Hamburg .	-4.7989
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a feed .	-2.7687

On Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district , Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the prosecutor Konstanz communicated on Friday .	-3.7655
15 accused people aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and warranted against them .	-9.8953
The officials also ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros .	-2.9089
Two persons were arrested at simultaneous raids in Italy vacation .	-10.1890
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy .	-1.9740
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany .	-2.3091
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.0463
Over 300 police officers were in use .	-11.1597
Mafia members are accused of organized drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-3.0080
Since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor 's Office has been identifying constance against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-4.0108
Kripo Rottweil ’ s investigators had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo .	-3.8719
Four officials from Palermo accompanied the major commitment on Wednesday morning .	-3.7926
The research targeted Italian nationals in particular with close reference to the Italian Mafia .	-13.9200
Also an incident in Hüfingen on 27 May , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the band 's account .	-4.2276
The Foreign Register ’ s Great Gaps	-4.4655
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : According to a report , the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-3.7774
This leads to serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-2.3877
The Federal Government ’ s refugee management representative , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to major gaps in the foreign central register according to a media report .	-10.1945
Defects in the data registered there could lead to " partially serious mistakes " in asylum procedures and deportations , warned in an analysis that the " Süddeutsche Zeitung " presents .	-5.1226
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are covered , including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.1682
The data will therefore be managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-8.2597
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of data has not been good up to now .	-15.4195
In individual cases , data from 1921 had been found " by people who have long been out of life , or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register " .	-4.6397
" Errorful data input can significantly slow return processes , " says the report further .	-10.6075
Furthermore , the statistics on people who are required to travel on departure are covered by EU citizens who would not have to travel at all .	-5.8203
Such false assignments , however , resulted in ' a distorted debate on the handling of exit persons ' , therefore the analysis states .	-5.7273
Meanwhile , the Federal Government appears to have begun to send refugee families with under 16 years of age to Italy once they have entered Ital. lililililililililililililili	-10.9658
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reported the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-3.1233
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures ' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and micro-children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-3.9432
Since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.3876
According to the Dublin Agreement , refugees of the EU State are responsible for achieving them first .	-3.5520
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that country can send it back to the entry country .	-3.3731
To justify , the office now writes : " Meanwhile , the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly " .	-4.4352
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.6532
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments sufficient .	-2.2419
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement .	-2.5923
The domestic spokesman of the left-wing group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticized this decision : " Families with children threaten human rights absorption conditions and a threat to the welfare of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system . "	-4.3508
The Second Best Result	-2.4668
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already provided the blood donation service to other people .	-3.2649
At least the twelve citizens awarded on Friday .	-2.2590

Traditionally , during the meeting of the Council of Municipalities the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-3.6998
" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for foreigners , nor to do so , " emphasised Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-5.6772
" A single donation of blood helps several people , " explained the Deutsche Roten Kreuzes ( DRK ) circular readiness manager , Holger Maisenbacher , because the canned are broken into their components .	-5.1911
Thus , three people could benefit from blood donation .	-3.0576
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring .	-2.4863
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRC Circle Readiness Manager .	-3.5467
Obviously , the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .	-3.4829
Before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations .	-3.0034

The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.2722
The Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation about rising .	-3.3107
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " bearable " when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure .	-3.1226
The Bank ’ s policymakers of the Monetary Committee ( MPC ) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-3.9940
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % , and for 2018 to 1.6 % , warning that pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-17.2450
But she signaled that interest rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to rein in Brexit ’ s fueled inflation , and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.1945
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut Economic Recovery Package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.5354
It will demand time for the financing plan to allocate cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .	-4.2357
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : ' In the central forecast of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption ' .	-4.0277
As regards interest rates , it repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' scale than markets expect .	-3.6268
Markets are currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.3120
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradual " and " limited " .	-2.7668
The Bank ’ s downward growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-3.0751
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.0123
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.3073
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.0069
The decision will not change after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an interest rate hike , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the second quarter .	-4.1087
Growth is expected to reach 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover at the end of the year .	-14.4554
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for budgets affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases , because tightening first becomes worse before it improves .	-4.1686
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " the income decline in the coming years , but she added that wages will recover " significantly " at the end of their three-year forli. lililililililili	-10.2999
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate part of lower consumption spending .	-3.3398
The decision comes one year after reducing interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote causing the decline of the pound .	-3.1549
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve full prices and the economy .	-2.7890
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-3.9177
Inflation fell from 2.9 % in June last month to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that this was expected and that it will attract it again in the coming months .	-3.6706
The Bank said that exceeding the 2 % target is " entirely " attributable to the weak pound .	-3.1989
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as creditors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.2629
The market looks particularly good for those who phase out the existing deals and complete the new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-3.3768
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people .	-2.5259
Patients will receive access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine .	-4.2723
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now supplied by the health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-3.8982
He agreed to fund the process after last year the Appeal Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-13.7923
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chairman Simon Stevens as an " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " crucial moment " .	-3.9052
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 throughout England .	-3.1328
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-8.4032
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in the event of infection vulnerable .	-3.1296
Taking PrEP before sexual traffic means that there are just enough medicines available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection limling in .	-12.1835
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual traffic .	-3.0352
Those who call into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-3.0112
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-2.7611
People living in England and registered with a doctor can also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic .	-3.1881
The programme will sign $ 10 million and NHS England a contract to supply drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .	-11.1239
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , which is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.4178
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.2733
It is another milestone in the progress that has been made over three decades in tackling one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . '	-3.7989
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.9872
PrEP , when targeted at people in need and at risk , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.4128
From September , people with high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .	-3.8425
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.6978
Ian Green , CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to carry out the study quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-3.2980
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-3.0858
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitation by the government .	-9.2373
The evidence shows how transformatively this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life-changing infection can end .	-2.9908
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-1.8317
Now it is important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will help us to bring about a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.2537
Living big life : Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.7743
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an Earls Court Apartment .	-2.7868
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-3.0125
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space , " says Joanne .	-2.4257
" I was looking for something comparable to my prize . lilililililililililili	-7.7151
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.2491
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . '	-2.9871
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet have been completely overtaken .	-3.7190
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to optimally use the spacious ceiling height .	-4.4763
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light .	-1.9150
That was my requirement , " she says .	-2.0058
For this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-11.2766
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate storey where one could stand .	-3.5421
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default .	-2.7431
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-7.6164
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked together without having to get back .	-3.7637
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . line. linelilililine . lilinelilililililililineline	-11.5464
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .	-3.2397
For the middle floor , a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area .	-3.6461
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage serge mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.0093
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.9626
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer .	-3.0279
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.3024
At the entrance there are mirrored units for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-3.2536
By perceiving a more glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-2.5418
Cooking together is nothing new .	-3.2075
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.8825
" A little bit of engineering went into it , " explains Erfan from the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-3.9346
" It is counterweight , so it slides very easily when you push the door up . "	-3.2356
Thanks to the clever use of space and closet space , Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.4819
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated , " says Erfan .	-2.9770
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate based on the ground size ' .	-3.7726
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-4.3323
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan . little ! ! !!	-10.1906
" You don 't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.0263
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-1.6312
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing .	-3.9466
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-2.2061
Brothers Fight for USD 500 million Real Empire	-2.6714
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a discussion about one of the largest real estate empires of Victoria worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.2016
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided .	-9.0169
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.1301
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 real estate worth more than $ half a billion , since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.2119
There , the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops .	-10.6772
It was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .	-1.4149
This money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .	-3.1928
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " main operator and dominant personality " in the family De Lutis - has about two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul about a third .	-4.1484
A court act states that this means that Colin has property worth $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-2.7628
The distribution of properties and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.6859
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit .	-2.6032
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.0104
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - from which Colin , as Paul claims , excluded him .	-3.7805
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently .	-2.5700
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-2.2473
" My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.2014
The cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages of affidavits , emails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-3.7155
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.1546
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansladen of the family .	-3.0691
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was " in my last years the high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .	-9.9635
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property friendly to their sons .	-2.8573
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " she wrote .	-1.9863
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when leaving the company .	-3.1089
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says , " became bitter about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-3.3399
Colin has kept himself very back , although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star .	-4.4856
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.4131
Only Colin answered by SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-2.8083
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.4647
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court in a letter that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .	-2.6196
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hoped for a solution " .	-2.9081
On Friday , this hope seemed over .	-2.0874
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.2074
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.4976
Others tried and failed .	-1.3798
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-7.3993
If so , he will be the first .	-1.1826
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including the news media reports , in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course .	-3.3082
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.2300
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior employees on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that goes into the president ’ s hands .	-4.0159
Kelly said to employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . '	-8.0648
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diagnosis .	-1.9689
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.7650
" When candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts that were to be convinced , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-4.1010
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control is , according to six former campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . '	-2.9850
Okay .	-0.4502
But the idea that Trump ’ s twitter habit was ever “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-8.3824
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know to others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions .	-3.1395
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.5499
If his employees managed to keep him away from trouble several times , then their efforts have been worthwhile .	-15.7942
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.1954
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-3.4495
In May , Politico reported on the preference of advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-13.1982
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.2031
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is stiffening to find out where they come from .	-4.1015
This is precisely what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a bunch of leaks " in the White House .	-3.9295
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for harassment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence , or that he has expressed false accusations and revoked them in the past .	-4.3103
Trump read the article and began to question staff about Walsh . '	-8.9629
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary-General , Rob Porter , have tried to ' implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that Trump receives ' .	-3.9920
How did this work ?	-1.6643
Kelly tried to do the same three months later .	-1.7332
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than a priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still striving for influence .	-2.6926
These invariable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.1493
Most sought-after criminals receive Europol ’ s liliclililicence	-8.2161
As the address is unknown , the population ’ s assistance is requested and hoped .	-3.6134
The police throughout Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals on escape this summer .	-2.9999
As the addresses of the heavy criminals sought are naturally not known , information from the population is hoped and requested .	-4.4583

Experience showed that many refugees hide from holiday destinations , it was called Europol .	-3.3902

Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' Millionaires ' series	-2.7701
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands return to war with some determined travellers who negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to claim a field before their mansions .	-5.1954
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the " Millionaires series " .	-3.5311
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May , but without having been deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incidents .	-8.8741
The tactful group found a gap in defence facilities and pressed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-3.1733
Furious inhabitants have pressed the Solihull Council , which said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-3.9898
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath where they thrown stones onto the passers-by .	-3.7405
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.2383
The travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back .	-2.7090
More arrived last night , probably more tonight . '	-2.4769
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks .	-2.7086
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.0142
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-3.7237
The figures have increased this time and even a horse has been seen in the parking area ' .	-3.1898
A spokesman of the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihull , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move on as quickly as possible .	-4.6133
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour with the police by calling 101 .	-2.9459
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . '	-3.6762
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise	-1.5119
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-2.3684
The house is currently being renovated in front of the gates of Freudenstadt and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-3.1739
These are good news for the city .	-1.1037
The closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 lost around 30 000 overnights per year and also revenue from the tourist tax .	-11.0469
In autumn 2014 , given dramatically rising numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collection accommodation , causing controversial discussions .	-4.6212
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the establishment of a plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-14.2915
The decision was not undisputed at the time in the Council of Municipalities .	-2.7019
But , above all , joyful city mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .	-5.2842
He should be right .	-1.7625
The Group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-4.4424
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter Object .	-3.1144
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.3313
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.8968
At the former Hotel Birkenhof , building containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is done .	-5.2134
The floors were torn out , ceilings were partly dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-3.8911
The entire hotel building is a single construction site .	-2.0505
Much remains to be done by March .	-1.5270
" It is actually a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.3921
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.2718
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers , the entrance area is refurbished , new windows are built in . listlililililililisted lilistlililists	-15.8828
Everything should later become " beautiful citizens " , as Thomas Scherer said .	-3.6211
" We want to make a jewelry out . "	-12.4900
Swimming pool , wellness area and conference room are equipped with all the facilfacfacfacilfacil.	-17.2972
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but already at a high downtown level , emphasizes Scherer .	-4.6546
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to sit broadly , explains Scherer .	-3.6662
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hfactorend ! !	-11.1543
Conversations with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause have already been held , says Scherer .	-3.3308
The city ’ s ideas are equal to those of the hotel group .	-9.8170
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.5627
As regards the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to specify exactly what is .	-10.7121
Just under one million euros , he expects .	-2.7938
The external facilities are also brought to the forefront , which is already clearly visible .	-4.1018
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .	-3.8364
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.6185
Russia ’ s affair : US Special Investigator uses Grand Jury	-2.8774
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump , special investigator Robert Mueller is to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-3.8784
The body has started work over the last few weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " appointing people to be familiar with it .	-14.8902
The newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations .	-2.7938
The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first submissions from the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.2655
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of having targeted interference in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-2.5815
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.1732
The focus of the investigations is on several men who acted as Republican advisers in the election campaign .	-3.6718
According to reports , Mueller also examined more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.2221
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally moved to the centre and examined the accusation of whether the president might have hampered the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-5.1107
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to charge charges .	-3.8876
Grand Jurys are therefore also called chambers of charge .	-3.1014
They are usually enabled when they are larger and controversial cases .	-3.3222
The procedure is always behind closed doors .	-1.7227
The body can also be intervened by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-4.3046
According to the CNN transmitter , submissions have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.7935
People who were involved in the meeting were invited to make a statement , the report said .	-8.7499
They should also provide documents .	-1.0796
Besides Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and then his campaign chief Paul Manafort , were also present in the talk .	-4.3528
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the setting shows that Mueller does not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he wants to act quickly .	-3.9034
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up being enabled to decide on the charge .	-4.0066
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-3.6930
In the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.7160
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.7153
The issue gives the Democrats a way to ' feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about ' .	-3.4379
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , declared in an opinion that he knows nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.3368
However , they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-4.0099
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a " fair " way .	-3.0712
The former FBI leader , James Comey , said three times that no president would be determined .	-12.4462
There is no reason to assume that something has changed , as the statement continued .	-4.1170
But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired .	-2.3757
Because of this dispute , accusations against Trump had become clear that he wanted to hinder the judiciary .	-4.0449
In June , Comey said in front of a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.4697
The President is under great pressure due to the investigation .	-2.3607
After the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees .	-3.1520
Speculation triggered whether Trump Mueller wants to release .	-9.4167
Unlike an independent Congressional special investigator , such as the Watergate affair around President Richard Nixon , who resigned later , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the insistence of the President .	-3.9745
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step .	-2.3864
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented legislation on Thursday that the special investigator could no longer be released so easily .	-3.3835
Antarctica ’ s Gigantic Iceberg Drives in Antarctica	-2.2369
In Western Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg has dissolved itself from the Schelfeis from just under seven times the size of Berlin .	-4.5455
This was informed by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.2832
Over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5,800 square kilometres now drive north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-4.5607
With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice giants who have registered researchers over the past three decades .	-3.8927
There is no danger to people .	-3.1167
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear according to research indications .	-3.3590
In total , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for about 30 years , writing the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a fact background .	-3.7279
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming .	-2.4499
So far , the coloss has been part of the Larsen C shelf .	-5.4206
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-1.9048
It is therefore continuing to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .	-4.4050
Larsen C Schelfeis is located south of South America nearly at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-2.9179
North of this celestial was the balance of growth and cancellation a few years ago .	-3.1447
A complete schelfeis is disintegrated there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.6825
There are some things to say that the Larsen C Schelfeis is also at risk , because the front edge has never withdrawn as much as it is now .	-12.9180
Furthermore , the ice plate is under tension and could be disintegrated if a piece cancels at a key point .	-5.1218
Melting Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase sea levels , since they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as after the melting itself .	-10.2266
However , the loss of the Schelfeise causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before .	-4.3376
This could possibly increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.1213
The Larsen C Schelfeis is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica , according to AWI indications with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-4.5349
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-2.9273
It regularly disappears there .	-4.0675
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of British Swansea University .	-3.7140
" This is the widest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.6826
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide , his colleague Adrian Luckman said , and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.1328
But this development will take decades .	-1.5747
Although these researchers do not attribute to climate change the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg , many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have been disintegrated in recent decades .	-5.3264
This long Antarctic summit extends towards South America .	-2.7861
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice-surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-9.7620
The temperature increase contributed to the decline .	-2.2670
The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming around three degrees over the last 50 years and is one of the areas where the temperature is rising most rapidly .	-4.4089
CDU wants house tariff for staff	-3.6916
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies , the CDU demands that the employers ' association leave to become more attractive .	-4.1365
Just before the summer break , the Kreistag has gained 41 new posts in the administration .	-3.4991
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circle administration in Mettmann .	-2.3028
Once again , 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .	-3.7858
The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very desirable .	-3.0575
About 620 applications have been recorded for the places to be granted this year .	-3.3535
However , the circle continues to lack staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks .	-3.4751
At present there are still 50 unoccupied posts at the Mettmann district .	-3.4800
Among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .	-3.5100
The CDU now wants to take the initiative in the Kreistag together with the FDP and the UWG and counteract the lack of professionals in administration .	-4.3267
The administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development according to the parties ' wish. lililililililililililililili	-10.7973
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals , but to counteract the shortage of applicants in the future , it is said .	-4.5746
The overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally , identifying concrete measures for cross-beginners and including a training offensive , demanding CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.7429
This sounds like a good approach .	-1.9699
Because the circle is dealing with personnel problems , which were not known earlier .	-12.7643
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.1233
The talk is about a genuine ' competition of public employers ' .	-2.9813
In addition , there are a large number of employees who leave the service for illness or age .	-9.1105
High time for action , therefore , so that more jobs do not remain unoccupied .	-4.2664
But Klaus-Dieter Pölker , CDU leader , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-2.7692
He recently caused a thick surprise in the Kreistag , when he publicly questioned human resources coverage and stunned the other parties .	-5.6292
Peoples want to see all possibilities for leaving the local employers ' association .	-4.2394
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the circle administration should seek a household rate with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the cities of circles - " said peoples .	-14.7295
The CDU is thus trying to pay better for employees and officials than it actually provides for collective bargaining for the public service .	-4.3540
The salaries are currently exactly required , increases or more money exist only if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years .	-4.3492
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown in recent years .	-2.5888
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection securline limited to .	-10.2889
Last but not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel .	-7.4817
Italy Intensifies NGO migrant rescue boats	-3.2006
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .	-8.2264
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-2.6541
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rescue Organization , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-3.3953
The aid organisation , which has only been operating for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.6646
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-10.2384
'We can only judge all the accusations currently made after we have collected all the information and assessed the situation ' .	-4.0142
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Rettet ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.3402
It is suspected that his occupation takes hose boat migrants on board , which are delivered directly by human traffickers , and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again .	-4.9239
At least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.4815
The occupation is suspected of monitoring the authority of the Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-15.6419
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .	-15.0603
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to keep to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta , and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain . lilililililililililililili	-7.4054
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable because they would not bring ' substantial changes or disabilities ' to their bailouts .	-3.6224
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.6960
Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy following the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.2375
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.3089
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-2.9944
Rising and Trials	-1.7225
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin Outpost " and two host drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-3.5582
Three friendly guides were available .	-6.9104
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.7691
The Wachenheim castle and wine festival was a welcome extra .	-8.0655
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim .	-2.3912
The viewpoints were followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate Forest and the pre-stored plains .	-6.0730
In the meantime there were longer and longer rises for which long trials were rewarded .	-3.6724
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the People 's Festival Sausage Mar .	-13.4700
Again , the viewpoint was ranked at the viewpoint , connected by " flowing " trials and moderate rises .	-4.9812
On the last two days , many meters of altitude were again said .	-5.1171
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and huts brought welcome breaks .	-1.8706

Console instead of lawns - Bundesliga equips itself for E-Sport	-3.1956
Do sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium grass in wind and weather ?	-4.3338
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included .	-3.1286
This has also been recognised by the first Federal League Associations , which are increasingly committed to this area .	-3.9046
At the beginning of 2015 , VfL Wolfsburg followed the FC Schalke 04 and last but not least VfB Stuttgart , who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .	-4.3535
" We hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the VfB , " says Management Board Jochen Röttgerme .	-10.2338
He is sure " that on this turn a number of clubs will climb up " .	-4.4222
Next weekend , the FIFA World Football Association in London organizes the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in which the gamers of different clubs compete .	-4.0543
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.5940
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.7428

With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , one could be far more frequently present online on these markets than sending the Federal Ligame Team to Asia once a year .	-4.5724
What exactly is it about ?	-2.1741
In e-sport , computer games like " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or just the FIFA football simulation are fought out at competition level .	-4.0799
Leagues , as in normal sports , have long established themselves in which professionals compete against each other .	-4.2996
E-Sport is already part of the official programme in Asia ’ s 2022 games .	-3.2830
But is this a real sport at all ?	-2.7519
For many , the idea is certainly needed to be used to . lili, lili, lilililili, lilililililililililit	-11.2981
Ingo Froböse has long addressed the issue .	-2.9712
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne , e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-3.9726
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid response capabilities .	-3.1063
Professional gamers should train not only on the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .	-3.0584
" The fit player is a good player . "	-1.6563
However , Froböse also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a subject " .	-3.6047
Controls are difficult to implement in online games , and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport .	-3.3655

However , the e-sport " is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , write the deloitte consultants .	-3.7684
Many countries are already international .	-2.3664

Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that Conrad Roy pushes for suicide	-8.7257
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to suicide by texts and calls .	-2.5098
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on proven .	-2.8371
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.8974
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is incomfortable .	-2.3518
My son was my best friend . '	-1.0581
Carter was allowed to remain free until it was appointed .	-3.0579
She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .	-3.2114
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when she was sentenced .	-3.7820
" Their actions killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.8694
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-1.9004
She has taken no responsibility , " she said .	-2.3950
" She has not shown repentance " .	-2.7432
But Carter ’ s lawyer said that it is a “ terrible circumstance that she completely regrets . ”	-3.0750
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find that her ' age or maturity , or even her mental illness , has a significant impact on her actions ' .	-3.6201
A public prosecutor reads a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is " no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son .	-3.4747
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything , and I try to be here for his sisters , despite all the pains that we will bear for eternity with us ' .	-11.9935
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she was " persecuted " by the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children .	-3.6886
" No longer having this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.8659
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.6030
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.3034
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-2.6975
" Hang up , jump from a building , start yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-3.6535
At the moment before his suicide she wrote : ' You must do it , Conrad ' and ' All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.3353
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from the case by any press .	-3.2733

Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the New Mini Lahm of the FC Bavaria	-2.0702
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .	-2.8286
The FC Bayern entrusts the Confed-Cup winner with a big season - extra motivation does not harm there . !! !!!!!!!!!!!!	-10.2178
Something was different in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even though the additional clothing was very small .	-3.8428
But since , of course , no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel New were visible on the second day of the Audi Cup , he stopped the bind assigned to him .	-5.0800
" The trainer did not announce it , " the confed cup winner afterwards told him after his first bet as a Bavarian captain .	-11.9381
Well , the admission could have been better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.2908
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich so .	-3.0094
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal had been selected as a game guide in the C-Elf consisting of youth players , debutants and professionals who just come from the holiday , but he was .	-6.0716
Sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep their mood .	-4.4788
Those who have been chorned to enter the legacy of lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-4.5950
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want to take responsibility as a player " .	-3.0797
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flitted as a mini-lahm over the field .	-3.2254
Right back , that is his position , the white bind at the arm did their rest .	-4.0270
And even Kimmich worked in this starting formation like the one who could best take the rudder into the hand .	-5.6676
He gave instructions , tried to direct the unplayed troop .	-2.6475
He had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .	-3.6267
Vidal through his missing fitness ( hardly folded ) ; Renato Sanches through his devil comes out to the services of the Asian journey ( folded only conditionally ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle do not negatively notice in their first appearance in the Bavarian journey .	-7.8933
After all , that worked very well .	-3.3648
Süle ran next to Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acted sovereignly .	-10.2549
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult to occupy , and Süle also tried to succeed in building games a few times .	-5.1935
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped for ' .	-3.1247
But he also showed proper performance in the debut .	-3.0272
Game relocation , tempo change : " For this style I was also fetched " .	-4.5203
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the new accesses , one looked after the game .	-10.8136
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two in the catacombs , but determined six or seven interviews .	-2.4838
Kimmich adopted after a few cricky statements in the back of his new players .	-3.6673
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle : " What is going on here , I have already noticed .	-3.8416
At Bavaria you just have to win every game " .	-2.7262
After all , he no longer needs to teach the new .	-2.6121

Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissing ’ s Tempo	-3.1048
It was often inconsistent , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.3781
This is evident after more than a year in which the new economic minister , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-8.4299
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at the same time as the old minister .	-4.0045
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trier Undertakings ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-3.3307
The biggest turning point is Natus in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country 's priorities list .	-4.7898
This year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure , and until 2021 the construction law will stand .	-4.4292
The country ’ s plans also play a role in the Western bypass of Trier , which is the primary need for the Federal Road Path Plan .	-5.0541
The aim is to operate the route in December 2020 , says Ministry Speaker Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.2292
Natus sees it as a sign to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-2.7699
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , aims at a Rhineland Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports , which has been sacked for ten years .	-4.9335
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to found their own company , praises the IHK .	-3.6752
The Trier Chamber of Commerce sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.1126
A premium of EUR 1000 for the existing master test and EUR 2500 if graduates become independent within ten years of master training .	-4.4754
The homework list for the country remains long , however .	-9.6436
At the same time , the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , the main managing director of IHK Trier .	-4.2215
Of 56 new engineers who want to stop wissing mobility at the national business , only 29 posts have been filled up to now .	-5.8392
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .	-2.3237
CDU Group vize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors , which in 2017 and 2018 invest more than EUR 20 million less in the preservation of national roads than proposed .	-3.6281
Frank Natus also expects a country ’ s concept of how it wants to remedy the lack of professionals in the region .	-3.7176
It is also sobering that broadband expansion has been in the country .	-3.9175
In 2016 , regional companies had judged power supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4 .	-3.3747
They complain about increasing internet connections and abortions .	-2.6791

Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - Car manufacturers face a backlash	-10.4275
One day before Audi announced , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.3666
The BMW Chairman said that the company was of the opinion that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-3.9592
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.0548
None of the companies described the companies as a recall .	-2.5188
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-2.6157
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-1.8569
The cost of car manufacturers to install plants to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-3.6227
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with mixing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.3782
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but driving back in normal driving conditions .	-5.0747
Several Volkswagen employees have been charged in the United States , others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.2330
Last month the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-11.6717
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.3695
Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen at the beginning of this year , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was extended .	-4.0285
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.4504
This Message on Saturday on Isar	-3.7627
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.4087
To ensure that the Isar visitors participate , a raft runs through Munich tomorrow on Saturday , which has a special mess.	-10.3026
When it moves to the Isar again on Saturday , there will be a great raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-4.3073
And this is not a common raft , with Isar tourists .	-2.7947
But the building referat wants to clarify .	-4.6872
The raft shows a great info transparency .	-3.7340
It shows a garbage mountain .	-1.9171
The beginning of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors ers .	-12.3104
The motto " True Love is ... " is intended to sharpen the understanding of Isar as a protective wild flow .	-3.8647

Mordilless Knollennases and Laughter Against Surffering	-4.1127
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon drawings , the Knollennasen of his figures are his trademark .	-3.3615
The Argentinian also draws 85 and works on a film .	-3.8011
His message : laugh , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-1.9220
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.9138
In the first years as an artist , he suggested , among other things , as a drawing for congratulations cards - which frustrated him .	-3.8245
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .	-2.2750
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he managed to break the breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in " star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.1258
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.5405
The artist of cities has always been inspired .	-3.0604
Large , rugged mordillo figures turn into drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-3.9369
According to his own information , he is still at the sign table in the early morning , working almost ten hdaily .	-16.9197
Through calendars , puzzles , books for large and small , t-shirts , plush animals and watches , his rolling figures continue to spread worldwide .	-4.1253
For six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters .	-3.1473
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - mordillessly popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as opponent .	-3.7314
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will come onto the cinema screen in 2019 .	-8.0882
" I do not know exactly what they will say it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.0874
The script is not written by him .	-1.3685
Therefore , he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wordless .	-4.0016
Lavender from Provence Threatens Climate Change	-1.9230
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.0795
The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of diseases , which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.2523
Eric Chaisse , expert from the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively threatened because in recent years the plant has been subject to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .	-4.3634
This has an impact on the life of lavender .	-2.4234
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.3169
And there is a great deal at stake .	-7.7603
Lavender oil tempts not only for holidaymakers , but also for perfume and cosmetics .	-3.5306
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.3010
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.0487
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-4.2322
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year .	-2.5097

The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-2.0360
Riodoce employees usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa through organized crime , corrupt officials and continuous drug wars .	-4.3773
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.3708
They have been told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.0119
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer : to take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the goal of an attack with grenades , or leave them at home .	-4.2605
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.5417
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed , perceptions and feelings of belly suffice .	-3.9065
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government or cartel ’ s pay list , a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-3.5544
There is no rest break from violence , and while the bodies are growing all over the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 ; 589 are under federal protection following attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.0138
Among the latter is their editor and inspirator of Riodoce , the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.5280
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs .	-2.7310
Its absence is deeply perceived , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the fa<unk>ade of the Riodoce building .	-5.3037
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-2.6156
Although a special prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated .	-4.0601
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.3365
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are incomfortable and although the terrain is even more treacherous .	-3.5973
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-8.5279
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.7585
" Until we know why , we all distrust . "	-3.2393
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-2.9427
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with " Twelfth River " .	-4.2222
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.4577
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8077
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.2638
Rumors tend to fly around Culiacan freely .	-9.0389
But there is virtually nothing silent about Valdez .	-2.5073
Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlegrounds since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , as rival groups are struggling to fill the vacuum .	-3.4566
There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the streets or that the graveyard is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings , which are larger than many houses for the living .	-4.4097
For one minute , forget that there is a state of " calm " if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States .	-3.2678
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is to blame for not being able to protect his friend .	-10.0291
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.5439
First of all , in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-14.7841
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.3395
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same history .	-3.1785
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.0922
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.0550
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars .	-9.9914
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.5567
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.9365
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat .	-3.4035
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce she received the prestigious " Maria Moors Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-9.2165
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history , wherever she led .	-3.2148
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.3584
" I want to continue , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.4543
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.0997
" You need to take on the task you have as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-4.0754
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-2.9628
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird that could curse like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.3991
They relied on his routine .	-2.0089
He would always bear his hat .	-2.1996
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.8701
Now they ask : was his love of routine his spoiling ?	-2.7299
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to best do their work and stay alive .	-3.3700
" You don 't like it if you deal with your women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways , " to move drugs .	-12.5399
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.5489
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-conservation .	-2.3476
His own instincts trust .	-1.6469
If it smells wrong , remain away .	-2.4455
The trouble is , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that ' smell is a sense that can be misled ... and then the thing happened with Javier ' .	-3.7934
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.3467
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.6586
In the space where Riodoce employees met for security training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed .	-3.8767
Outside two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.9199
They were commissioned by the national government to protect Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-2.9502
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 % of the police who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-3.3943
It is months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.5170
Riodoce has looked at three main stories for this week ’ s edition .	-10.0960
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.0570
They also had an exposé to government spending , which focused on the home city of the governor .	-2.9750
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the prosecutor .	-2.9452
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so was cautious when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities .	-3.5253
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century .	-3.2183
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high-quality cases of corruption .	-2.8271
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-2.5883
Just a few months earlier , readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping .	-2.9503
" Before we had already known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of his slim body stature .	-11.0492
" Now all channels of communication have broken with our sources . "	-2.2569
The Valdez office has been transformed into the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something they would never have expected : activists in the name of the press .	-8.6354
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped himself a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-3.3246
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.9078
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-10.5069
All over the country , journalists have become more vocal by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on paths and buildings .	-3.6654
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-3.4398
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and killing them because they said the truth .	-2.8750
Since then , she has asked that it be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-3.8178
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are " surrounded " by organized crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .	-2.5319
In his last book " Narco Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also by orders of politicians and security forces that were under one ceiling with organized crime .	-3.9970
Last year , the Articulo 19 media guardian group has allocated more than half of the attacks on police and officials journalists .	-14.3700
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.2164
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-11.4723
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.0046
Your body was found together with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-3.0858
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head .	-2.0908
Some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.7442
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-2.6332
In 2010 , Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a leading article on the front page with the heading ' What do you want from us ? '	-3.5541
Some journalists have fled from their own countries or even from the country .	-2.6172
It is a painful decision .	-0.8163
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .	-9.1773
And sometimes they are hunted , as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico city three months after the escape from Veracruz .	-3.1601
For those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-2.8930
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-2.4668
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became reporters , " he said .	-2.3153
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Riodoce were on the path before the office and drank beer when at once all their phones began to sum up .	-4.3786
A number of shooters with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-3.1258
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region .	-1.8103
From the boarding stone edge , you have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phones .	-3.7309
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.9213
Sirens howled up near - another shooting in the area .	-10.0204
Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who held guard to see if they were willing to .	-12.3650
If they were afraid , they did not show it .	-2.7458
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa , Riodoce staff followed his traces .	-3.6085
" How can you even think of closing down , " said Bojorquez , " if the same day Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send them to the street for reporting ' .	-4.8116
Dinosaurs used to avoid his enemies	-3.0758
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a terrifying one .	-2.1508
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-3.5292
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a " troubled past " .	-4.1424
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called it " the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world " .	-3.0006
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaur living in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-11.6429
Its incredibly well-preserved state has surprised researchers who describe it as " really remarkable " ,	-9.8557
According to reports in National Geographic , the armoured plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-2.8299
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.3223
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-2.7850
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.3054
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clump .	-2.6721
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-1.9204
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature can be seen .	-3.6831
" It will enter the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . "	-3.3001
Researchers have found that this plant eater , although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs .	-3.8658
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white carnival to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as countershade , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.0262
This would have allowed to mix better into its surroundings and evade its enemies , experts say what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-4.1212
The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.3026
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it .	-3.2837
The astonishing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-3.1960
They discovered contershading , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.2540
Although contershading is customary , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today ’ s animals .	-4.0632
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure from meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.5009
But most contemporary animals that use contershading - think of series , zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaur was subject to a real struggle for survival .	-4.0419
" Strong predators behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of chalk time must have been , " said Brown .	-4.1312
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.1823
Scientists continue to examine the animal 's indications of his life , including his preserved intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-3.6974
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was pushed into a river and driven into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .	-4.1133
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-2.7102
" This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-3.5051
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in early chalk time .	-10.8685
They do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . '	-11.7113
The chalk time was a time when huge theropods , meat-eating dinosaurs , stood on two legs , passed through the earth .	-4.8789
Although the king of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex , millions years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-3.0108
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .	-2.7788
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the specialist magazine Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was sank and mummified after death in the sea .	-4.0119
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Albere , e e e e e e e e e e e e e e	-8.8956
According to the museum it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snout to the hip .	-8.8700
The creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long on average and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) len.	-4.4890
It contained two 20-inch long peaks that ran from his shoulders .	-3.9537
Researchers believe that the armored plant eater was flooded through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-3.2252
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.1882
The stoned remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover tank plates along the dinosaur .	-4.3180
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto .	-12.1370
The more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .	-10.2227
Steinered remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that wear the skull of the animal .	-4.4804
His right front foot lies on his side , his five fingers are spread up .	-3.7832
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.6926
In Storm : Mass Carambolage on A8 : Many Injured	-2.7002
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.3678
There are numerous injured , kilometres of congestion and gaffer .	-3.2975
On the highway Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on Thursday afternoon .	-3.5959
According to the police first statements , nearly 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were collapsed between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aichach-Friedberg district ) during a thunder .	-5.0280
There was no information about the exact number of injured .	-2.9798
They are easy to medium-sized injuries , a police spokesman said .	-2.8739
A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident point .	-3.1685
The A8 was fully blocked towards Munich .	-2.2518
In the direction of Munich , a roughly ten kilometres long backlog was formed .	-4.6491
As an AZ reporter reports , there were massive disabilities on the counter-road - by numerous Gaffers .	-4.5344
The fire brigade listed the characteristics of the vehicle steerers who now have to expect sensitive penalties .	-4.4709
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.4379
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-2.7787
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident point .	-2.6847
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.6072
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing suspicious is sitting in the train and sleeping .	-3.7326
Or you are deepened in his work and have just a brilliant thought .	-3.3510
And then : bufff .	-1.5521
Comes the creator and awakens a smooth or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-4.5582
Ticket control .	-1.0522
But the times of interruptions are soon over .	-2.2963
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing creative ticket control .	-2.7255
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue your ticket .	-3.7778
Currently a test company is running on two routes .	-3.1130
" If the offer arises , we extend it .	-2.9607
It will then probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance traffic routes in Germany , " said line sp.	-9.7948
" Comfort Check-in " calls the railway the ticket devaluation without a Schaffner .	-4.7765
To use them , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.0573
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do .	-3.2214
It is also necessary to book the app of the train that DB Navigator bought , which is anyway the most comfortable way of booking tickets .	-4.7748
And last but not least you need a seat reservation .	-2.9517
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.5319
A button for electronic devaluation appears for test customers .	-3.1726
The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and taken the booked seat Y .	-4.0313
He knows that a passenger with an already devalued online ticket is sitting there at the time of ticket control .	-5.4560
We can therefore continue to sleep , continue working , remain silent .	-4.1556
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should be used by passengers .	-3.9183
" If you want to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying staff , check in at the DB Navigator yourself .	-4.5285
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Far Transport .	-3.4901
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.0550
Anyone who often travels by train knows that , besides delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the greatest annoyances .	-4.4752
Because you often have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets .	-4.4387
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or otherwise a document you have to present .	-4.3215
The result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , leading to poor mood in the part or large area and delays in controlling your own ticket and ultimately taking the time to address other concerns .	-5.3017
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-2.0295
And this also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-2.8784
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked .	-2.9238
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Whose Streets ? "	-1.7068
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core .	-2.5199
Only a day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled by Facebook on her phone .	-8.2300
She stumbled over a post by someone from the high school .	-2.3991
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " said there .	-3.3207
Confused , because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.5673
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline .	-2.2336
The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was killing the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson , Mo . , to tweet live .	-3.3888
He posted a picture of Brown 's lifeless body , stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .	-3.5077
" That is wild " , Ferrell thought .	-3.1040
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.5988
She laid her mobile phone to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield drive .	-12.9273
There were photos of the police band and people who cried , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father who went a sign with the inscription : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-4.0972
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a dog .	-3.9327
In another video , she said , a different policeman unscribed his gun and shouted : " I will kill you ... Animals all kill . "	-4.5049
" That is not common " , Ferrell remembered her statement .	-8.5275
'That is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to and which we can call typically . '	-3.5735
At this moment I felt shaking frost .	-2.7668
I was angry and crying . '	-1.5640
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.4594
After the landing at 23 : 00 , she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-3.6870
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from 11 .	-7.9968
It is a story of survival and protest , of love and loss , of strength and resilience consisting of the view of the people who live in the Community and filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.0383
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state <unk> .	-4.2429
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-2.8523
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.9302
I could not take them with me , " said Ferrell later .	-2.1289
" What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past .	-2.0127
It must know and see it and be raised in it .	-2.9715
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various classes of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to free ourselves .	-3.1166
Although I am fortunate to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black women 's child .	-3.9241
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it . '	-3.8478
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson likely .	-16.0152
There Ferrell and her daughter connected to a local business owner who made lunch .	-3.0230
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters .	-2.2437
Slowly , a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell .	-2.3867
" My activism totally changed after 9 August , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St . Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.5457
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.2794
Everything has happened . ' lililililililili!	-9.6625
Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.0394
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-1.8394
One question came to Ferrell 's mind : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.3603
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people , often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.2979
As Folayan recently said in an interview , ' We had heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.2132
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death stract occupants .	-3.2529
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-3.2692
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us " , said Davis .	-2.8671
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented . "	-4.3567
The aim was not to concentrate on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a messias leader , but a community that comes together " , said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the film .	-3.8507
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-2.9076
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.0422
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . "	-2.9900
Furthermore , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement .	-2.8720
Two of the three founders of the movement that , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , characterized the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.1401
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we constantly fight on various fronts .	-3.3652
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything ' .	-2.2893
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women " .	-1.9721
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.1544
" She was the person who stirred up this energy , " she said .	-2.7932
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life at these crossings as a black , gay woman so much is at stake .	-3.6456
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.0605
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police remain .	-16.5456
Ferrell is on proven for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.3437
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-11.5812
Nevertheless , she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-4.6387
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.0141
It is our duty to win .	-1.0072
We must love and support each other .	-1.2644
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-1.8444
From " dream " to " size disease " : TV readers discuss Bit Gallery	-2.9719
The bit gallery moves people although it is not built yet .	-3.0855
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern side of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.4532
Cold leaves the subject hardly any one .	-3.8416
Our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " also discusses the topic .	-8.8808
While some say to the bit gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , comes from the other side : " Need no man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Siggi Betzen ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-4.5135
While advocates build on a gallery drawing more customers into the city , which also benefits other shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed .	-11.4051
In addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers ' market hall is located , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-4.3555
This will stop at the beginning of the construction work .	-3.3196
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with possibility to seat outside .	-3.8668
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying for many years almost weekly in the farm market ! !	-11.4192
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of land women are always very happy .	-4.2934
We also discovered the butchery for us .	-8.0297
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-3.6687
There are other towns as well livin.	-12.5023
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting . '	-2.6896
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of the rent is required .	-3.9155
However , this is unlikely to be low in the new project . '	-4.4754
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-2.2726
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets : I find that superfluous .	-2.4434
There are enough of them in our city .	-2.9116
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.0620
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we remain at least the market hall .	-3.9436
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also cheap .	-4.1850
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer .	-4.3684
It is a pity that special businesses are almost no longer available and what is left of them will probably disappear . '	-5.1170
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me .	-2.3199
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.7691
Above all , where should the farmers ' market hall go during the construction period ?	-3.9575
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-3.1842
Or does the Spenst Bit Gallery manage to distribute all shops from Bitburg before ? '	-3.6145
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-1.8929
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.6136
In my view , it would have been better to promote a real farming market rather than this gallery .	-3.1310
But there is no place for a farmers ' market hall , thanks to the madness of many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-4.6742
If the farmers ' market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-2.9557
A suitable similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-1.7924
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-3.7720
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek-tuppers and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.4606
Manning sent the cuts from the prison Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making diplomatic messages secretly classified on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.3905
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable similarity ) .	-2.8250
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and manning , a transfer and groundbreaking dissident , whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-12.7770
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA , extracted by manning and created from the 30 portraits , as someone might look like these genomic data , has a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only about the formability of DNA data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also about identity .	-5.0455
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six infringements of the Spying Act , Computer Fraud and Theft .	-4.3129
Through the prison , her image was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a granular black and white selfie where manning is visibly unwell sitting on a driver seat and wearing a platinblond wig - with which she was associated .	-5.1050
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.2417
In it , the artist produced portraits of foreign artifacts such as cigarette tumble and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like .	-4.6767
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-8.9574
" They led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-2.9576
And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so contact Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.4034
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letters who exchanged several letters over two years .	-3.2539
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be converted and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-3.4939
The fact that Obama would call for Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas only a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.6995
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways of flaming the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .	-4.8973
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.6011
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , manning demanded with its oversized signature ( the " i " in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which was gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-4.9252
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-2.8254
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all , by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) .	-3.3392
" What people hopefully will take with them is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-3.7998
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . "	-3.0698
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novelle .	-3.6150
She shows manning how she emerges with a hand-free phone from the United States ’ disciplinary barracks like King Kong .	-4.7063
" If they cold your speech , they won , " says .	-3.6550
" So never keep the mouth " .	-2.5202
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greets from Philadelphia .	-2.4907
" I still get goose skin when I talk about it . "	-3.0793
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as was predicted in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be welcomed in the middle of the space by the masks , by their own genomic simulacres , who collaborate like hordes of protesters .	-5.1668
This was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 , mannings stature ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-3.6602
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.4247
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , such as the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-3.2839
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for Killing	-2.3439
A nationwide hunt for human beings is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are sought as suspects after a man had been destroyed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .	-4.2804
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as the files of the Cook County Court show .	-3.1433
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several times .	-2.1906
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-8.9303
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.5367
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the place of events , and detectives investigate the sticks as murder , while the police actively seek the two suspects , officials said .	-3.5739
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-1.8962
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice-President of University Relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on holiday and was excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus .	-3.4590
" This is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-2.6967
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-1.3001
A spokesman from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that ' we are in contact with the United Kingdom 's police force and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible ' .	-3.9927
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up .	-2.5804
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he urged the suspects to face the authorities .	-9.0271
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them are strengthening , " said Guglielmi .	-3.3159
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the suspects .	-2.0238
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-9.4850
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.3891
Guglilielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.7306
It has been confirmed by security cameras that lathem and warrens were in the building .	-12.0237
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.8045
The management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : ' The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident ' .	-3.4144
" We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future " - the Russian Vice-Premier Mutko	-2.5328
The Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-2.7714
" At a certain stage of compliance with the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-9.8581
The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.5172
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap on compliance with the code describing the criteria for reinstating RUSADA and recently published on the organization 's website .	-7.5165
According to Mutko , it does not contain anything that might give cause for concern to Russia .	-2.6736
" Everything has been announced , everything is implemented .	-1.7856
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.8796
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on allegedly state-sponsored dopings in Russian sport .	-4.1234
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : " We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has recognised a mistake .	-3.5762
All measures have been implemented .	-1.2567
But there were no government programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . . lilililililililililililili	-9.4822
Mutko ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the Independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission .	-2.4727
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov added problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-3.7341
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-2.2575
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal by WADA .	-3.0270
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.1438
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving " in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-3.3919
For the time being , Aldi No Eggs	-2.8474
That was informed by the company groups .	-2.8947
This is a mere precaution , and no health impairment could be expected , as the communication said .	-5.4410
From now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have been tested negatively on fipronil anti-housing products .	-4.9435

The Start Ups that will help your company not to become the Next Uber	-2.6619
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your e-commerce start-up , but the surveys did not work .	-3.1422
Answers were often vague , little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent .	-2.6263
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not dare the process .	-2.3321
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Serret , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .	-8.3944
It has called people from outside for help .	-2.0603
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-2.8668
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment , it allows companies to carry out surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases whistleblowers allow C-Suite executives to circumvent and contact the board directly .	-4.5172
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment .	-3.0932
Saved said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with glint .	-2.9047
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so you can drill down why .	-4.4030
Companies come to realize that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-4.4099
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.4262
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.0113
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the Uber case in discredit earlier this year .	-3.2937
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.4500
Uber recently registered as a client .	-1.5865
Like Glint , Convercent sends tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-3.7117
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-2.7171
And if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.6113
" The Court of Public Opinion has recorded the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent . lililililililililililililililili	-9.5858
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott , employee fluctuation , and actions , Quinlan said .	-14.1787
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .	-10.5354
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.2929
It was often an intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays ’ General Counsel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-2.8520
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives who were in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment , or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed more quickly likely .	-10.2388
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view in the experience of employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.4154
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-2.0933
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee commitment more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations of the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-10.7043
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online .	-3.7085
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.5734
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .	-3.1647
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups .	-2.9101
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-2.8487
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .	-3.0235
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.2560
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more of their jobs than they have done so far .	-2.9893
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only bets .	-2.6628
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-2.9945
" If people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.6439
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are committed and committed .	-4.0435
If third party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.5759
Data on employee commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture important .	-11.1728
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-2.8115
Indeed , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-2.8901
And if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees .	-3.1615
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 discussions , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data .	-3.4087
" If you do not follow , staff will ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.6824
Do you take care of this ?	-1.9014
And who do not take care of it , why should I ? '	-3.1425
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly staff surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about glint , said Save .	-7.3224
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company by speeding up decision-making and the quality of communication , and adding a communication training to address the problems .	-3.7733
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is always gaining new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to better links between workers in an industry known for high sales .	-4.5334
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.7471
" And if you lose people , you lose customers .	-2.1245
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.0324
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins	-2.3338
A lot of UCLA football players talk to the team on the campus at 23 o 'clock .	-5.1213
Some have pulled out their trikot top parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.0478
For a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .	-11.1204
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Wasserman Football Center at 6 : 30 am the next morning .	-4.7263
" This is a true Tretmühle for the guys the next three days , " said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.5739
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players and has actually extended their days - at least until Friday 's final .	-10.5704
Therefore , the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19 : 15 to meet the players ' already fully packed timetables .	-4.4002
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six game hours in Westwood practical exercises .	-3.9887
They will hold 18 exercises during August , 20 before the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-4.0512
Mora said that he supports the NCAA rule change even if he adds another point to the player 's multi-busy routes .	-4.7189
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.3855
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to pick up , they are great people .	-9.9110
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . '	-3.3413
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear views of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been applied with footballs that granted a protection network behind a gate post .	-5.9257
Bruins players should fill the hotel this weekend , but Mora admitted that there might be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-3.4069
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.6770
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people there rent a room and then adapt to record an exercise .	-4.1932
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite good business .	-3.1374
However , we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-11.7668
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.2275
I am therefore not worried too much .	-2.8162
We have a plan . '	-0.9184
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in the fight against counterfeit news	-9.6110
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fact checkers from third parties and then display their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news .	-4.4641
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to fact checkers who may display results of the fact check from the original article .	-4.5164
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called Fake News , many of whom believe that they have also influenced US presidential elections in 2016 .	-3.1839
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful postings as they did before the elections there in September .	-3.8806
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.0504
" In addition to knowing which stories are challenged by fact reviewers of third parties , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for facebook messages in a blog .	-3.6388
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and will work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .	-3.5522
Creating a Comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.0199
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle was shown in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-2.9294
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophair Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-3.5317
" I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says humiliating .	-3.0774
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-1.8136
A Castle in England spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney .	-24.5679
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .	-2.6751
" I only responded to the thumbnail impression on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's working for the Jakobiner , " he says .	-4.0289
" That is his thumbnail impression !	-2.3745
And letters always smell of smoke , because then a fire was ignited because of light .	-12.7829
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were here .	-8.8224
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.5710
For someone who is beaten with old papers so that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle nearly four months ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .	-4.3903
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the assembled hyene heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in digging .	-14.1919
He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care , gardeners and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-4.0189
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and began to write " .	-2.0389
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heritage , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.0615
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees just began to take care of the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the attic " .	-3.5471
Diaries , letters from the era of the English Empire , maps that represent who owned what : " One might think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch that fought for the two families .	-4.2030
Guys , let everything go his course ! "	-10.2863
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmers ' uprising of 1381 .	-4.2626
" There is a record of a turmoil that appeared in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-2.4170
" The farming uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good beginning .	-2.8732
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-2.0697
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the history of the Jesuit pater , which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English reformation .	-3.8456
Or ' The Smuggler ' , where the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell was presented , staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-3.7974
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be pretty patrons , always make debts and spend money on things they could not afford .	-10.6287
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crises by marriing rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good guys , with a talent to advertise wives . '	-3.9659
After the end of its use in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences	-2.9901
He has brought behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early twentieth century , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-4.0622
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.4884
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.5087
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to cope with the damned life . '	-3.6865
Started campaign : More than 300 years old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf covered	-3.2973
With the coverage of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau von Thursday ) .	-4.5014

" Beautiful for us !! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-9.6286

" We do not really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their website unlocked yesterday .	-3.9478
" But we use this measure to gain attention .	-9.2238
And to make it clear that some is better than it seems .	-1.9653
Basically , we are firmly convinced that we , as Bad Honnefer citizens , know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-3.2575
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it continues .	-2.5190
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistakable selling feature " .	-4.3164
After all , it is competing with other communities .	-2.5484

Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-1.7925
Every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and transport in the officer corps .	-3.4078
This week too .	-2.1419
At first glance a normal process .	-1.6675
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.3949
The sitting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .	-3.7786
The five Vice-Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs have now participated in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government .	-3.9469
Thus , civilians in the YAS were overnumbered .	-3.6831
The government attracts reins in the military .	-1.9778
Although Hulusi Akar remains in office , the commanders of the army , the air forces and the navy were dismissed .	-3.9916
Since the failed coup , Erdogan fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.1887
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army ranks - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who Erdogan sees as the wire holder of the coup attempt .	-4.4094
Ankara has been negotiating against 486 people directly involved in the coup attempt since this week .	-3.7819
On the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the collapse " God gift " because he gives him the opportunity to " purify " the armed forces completely .	-5.5141
But does Erdogan really have the army in control ?	-7.0499
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article with the heading " Unease in the Military Headquarters " .	-2.9520
The newspaper wrote in the General Staff concerns about an increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which manifests itself , among other things , in the lifting of the headscarf ban on soldiers .	-4.8111

In mid-July , Erdogan fired another 7395 state servants by decree , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-2.7369

The generals were previously considered the real gentlemen of the country .	-3.2116
Three times , they coupled with their role as guardians of the secular order of state .	-3.6041
Following his 2002 election victory , Erdogan reduced the military ’ s power step by step , not least with reference to the European Union ’ s reform targets .	-8.5123
Former officers say that Erdogan is specifically driving forces to Islamize .	-10.4602
The magazine " Vocal Europe " warned a non-named officer who was looking for asylum for fear of persecution abroad , that the Turkish army will be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years .	-11.1370
If that is the case , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-2.6883
There is no doubt about the Turkish army 's willingness to operate in the Alliance after the cleansing .	-4.1293

Washington Changes the Green Card Rules	-1.4066
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Trump said , quoted by the media .	-1.9955

Ministry wants to repair the race shuttle track	-4.1108
Over the past few months , the future of the racetrack shuttle has been disputed - now it will be very quick .	-5.7641
Before the end of the year , the fascinating route on which the tourist railway will take place is to be built .	-5.3979
In order to ensure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term , construction work will start on the route , according to the Transport Ministry .	-5.1907
" With the decision to continue to order and repair the Ilmenau racing route , the country commits to this important link , especially for tourism , " said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-5.0147
The cost of repairing the route was around EUR 2.5 million .	-3.0028
The country accounts for 75 % of this sum .	-2.5495
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being finally voted , explained Sühl .	-3.8715
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details .	-10.0293
" The road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " said Sühl .	-3.3751

Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the breast black and the type of fingernail . lilililililililililililililililili	-12.0181
" People make themselves funny about them , but companies provide a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-4.3283
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-2.8379
The user can also " customize " his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.5623
But it becomes even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " that a Stepford woman would look progressive .	-3.3038
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.8920
For example , the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as shy .	-3.8307
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shy and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-3.6363
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , " swarms the site of True Companion .	-11.9844
So she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc .	-2.3321
She also has her moods over the day - just like real people !	-3.5466
It can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be ' in mood ' ! '	-2.7882
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relations - but the subdued female characteristics , the references to rape when you take a step on Frigid ( here is reluctant ) farrah , worry most .	-5.0347
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-1.9940
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have roxxxy ? " says on the site .	-3.1894
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or hold only another sex toy .	-8.7144
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-3.8955
Most men will , of course , not keep sex robots , and while the FRR notes its rising popularity , they are still temporarily at the edge of consumer culture .	-10.9687
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live .	-3.3258
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives permission to them .	-13.3997
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots appear at a time when women 's rights are threatened worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted having attacked women sexually .	-4.0158
The most deterrent aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphical images , the swallowed bodies and the eyes broken out , but how realistic this vision works .	-4.7192
The Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .	-2.8718
The objective behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-2.8286
Their builders want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body .	-3.0971
But , when it comes to their " personalities " , robots are not real women .	-3.2559
You cannot separate from your pet or simply go away .	-2.9997
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-8.8913
In other words , they are pleasant slaves .	-1.9733
Or to put it in the 2017 speech : Service Girls	-2.7748
Trump ’ s great performance ?	-1.5355
He makes Mitt Romney common sense	-2.4472
It has become a wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format .	-2.9030
Around Christmas and Harvest , newspapers in the US gave advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump electing relatives .	-4.1280
We all supposedly strive to burst our filter bubbles .	-2.8214
Less noticed is Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-1.7343
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.0406
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.8314
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republican relatives with whom she fought for decades because of politics , is suddenly and quite strange on the same side .	-3.9308
That is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-4.4834
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the disruptive effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .	-3.2798
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his matches will no longer repudiate us . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.9325
There is , however , an even more appalling long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” Republicans of the right wing , who suddenly appear as the embodiment of sensibility compared to his standards .	-4.5217
Today , I find myself infected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urkomic version of the crazy – the dog on the roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like ) – both of which , in fact , occur a very mild crime compared to Trump . lililililililililililililililili	-11.4640
When Trump goes , Republicans ’ next candidate must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement .	-2.9821
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the carousels of the New York Park Department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-3.8573
The horses are enormously large , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are cruel and the animals twist themselves to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way .	-5.2982
So many stereotypes of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not fair to the dream .	-3.7495
Five and thirty years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major roundabout in northern London .	-3.8927
However , the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience , because here two years old , a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time .	-4.8664
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately no one asked about it .	-3.3455
On the other hand , I was forced this week in a department store to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.3165
In the coffeehouse on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compare the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something above the shop table .	-4.1377
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .	-3.3904
The poor woman in the department store was excusingly grinding , while I tired of experiencing her to reach my credit card with five stars .	-4.6849
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain from prison to hospital	-3.0902
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital for the second time .	-2.2957
Last year , due to the treatment of cuts on his wrists , he was brought to the hospital , according to the prison authorities , after a case in his cell .	-4.3478
Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after an appeal by prosecutors .	-3.6452
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.9251
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a night intruder hiding in the cabin .	-2.9391
Public prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too indulgent .	-3.3485
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said that it would oppose the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .	-3.6309
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his penalty to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .	-3.0166
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.9546
As a Bauer Arnold a Strange Egg	-3.1493
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the fourth classrooms were made redundant in the holidays and in the second schools .	-12.8070
Three of the dismissal students will go to the school in future , four to the real school .	-12.3894
School leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-2.7071
As a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and director Meder , chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken courtyard , but then be released into freedom .	-4.4410
The muntere shar led a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hühnerhof " .	-4.3100
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it broke out by his chickens .	-3.6117
Instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .	-2.2119
But the hope of making him a chicken crumbled , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and appeared .	-4.7507
Then the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .	-2.5650
The hens danced with the young gockles who were carrying cylinders to bet .	-3.8280
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-2.0552
The young animal is different from the other young animals ( chicks ) , but it is one of them .	-3.7736
But he will never be like a chicken . leleft leflelesleflesh .	-11.0773
Its provision is to be free .	-1.9829
She wished every fourth classmate to feel at home in his new school .	-3.8824
Thanks were followed by my fellow Members , the former school leader Michael Müller , who keeps stepping in educational shortages and the parents .	-5.5371
The cooking period is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-3.1362
She released her students after two years of lessons very unfortunately , because it was a really great time .	-4.3606
Finally , she was able to rely on the fourth class .	-14.2936
Finally , all students sounded a song of summer time and holiday time .	-2.7322
The children were very pleased about this .	-13.3937

Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece	-7.4321
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campings in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by TV .	-7.3371
On the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegally tending people in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.0480
On the same day they were released while an investigation is currently under way .	-2.5220
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later releed . left litling a litime .	-14.3518
The Greek authorities have exacerbated control of the free camps and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-3.7507
Controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.1450
The Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .	-2.1272
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles : What the affected now need to know . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-11.5376
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.8302
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?	-2.1509
The most important questions and answers overview .	-1.9563
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .	-2.6087
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars in the emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-4.2295
Euro-4 diesels or worse are excluded .	-1.8554
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.5093
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.4040
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.1763
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have fume software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.4918
Their retrofitting has been arranged by the Federal Office of Cars ( KBA ) .	-4.3385
How and from when will customers be informed about updates ?	-1.9907
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet mentioned a precise date .	-3.6463
Daimler announced that everyone concerned should be written .	-4.2922
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .	-2.7143
How long should the overall changes take ?	-3.1981
" Hard to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.3575
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and on political pressure .	-2.3561
'We have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the subject of the environment so far does not . '	-4.0982
How long should the update take ?	-1.7355
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.5464
Time consumption may be to get an appointment .	-3.2078
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.5147
The ACE advises waiting .	-2.0345
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow , says Smetanin .	-2.5511
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars ?	-3.5716
The ACE fears that .	-1.2988
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening .	-3.0669
In rural areas , there have been no loss of value for older diesel .	-9.6042
The ACE advises you to wait for a sale .	-2.5262
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award	-1.5727
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-14.3436
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political .	-2.0413
One of the winners does not want to come - from protest .	-2.3696
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-3.1529
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the apprentices .	-6.8033
The awards will be passed in early December .	-8.0674
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will receive a reception and will participate in the award together with his wife Melania .	-3.3373
The progressive TV series winner Lear has already announced that he would not participate in the Gala .	-5.2141
He said , ' New York Times ' : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to withdraw the funds - and that burdens me ' .	-4.4660
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the talk with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.2343
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.4309
Previous winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.0709
We Make the City Life	-2.3286
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s City Champion , will retire next year .	-2.7186
The job is already tendered , but appropriate applicants are rare .	-3.6819
For 31 years Wacker has been a city master .	-3.2499
And the work still makes him great fun as he conveys in the press conversation .	-3.6241
He reports about varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successors .	-2.9445
At the same time , he is surprised that no application meets the requirements profile .	-11.6100
The city is looking for an architect or building engineer as soon as possible .	-2.5666
In this way , while respecting the regular termination periods , there is still enough time for incorporation .	-5.5376
Because Haslach acts as the lower construction rights authority for the administrative community , the applicant must have the appropriate degrees .	-9.8910
Because this function definitely wants to keep the citfrom lililililililili	-9.8556
If they were not able to fill them out , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-12.4565
But closeness to the city and to it itself is important , says Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens .	-4.4841
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have gathered , looking back on the wackers with pride .	-11.0202
" We make the city livable " , it is safe through the building office and its employees .	-3.6264
But even in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Lower Hofen Parking Square , for example , have been initiated .	-5.3540
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and stadium renovation is still a topic .	-3.2318
The latter alone will beat at around EUR 1.5 million , " if we do it right " , estimates Wacker .	-4.2436
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.0546
The work here is fun . '	-2.0755
There is a large scope for a city master .	-4.8770
With Haslach ’ s own building house and gardening , many things can be reacted quite flexibly .	-4.5892
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green plants is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-9.6986
Because the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , whether it is important to " have an eye for what fits into " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city master emphasises .	-5.6798
Anyway , the city master bears high responsibility .	-3.8060
He is a builder , " at the end everything runs here over my table " .	-3.6205
When it comes to care and coordination , he can count on long-standing employees : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Low-Building ) for 15 years .	-5.0802
Also , that his successor remains long , Wacker wants : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place " .	-4.1298
Continuity is important not only for a good business climate but also for the further design of the city .	-3.2760
Those who want to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to study as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialized architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning .	-5.8057
The city construction office is subject to high and low construction , construction planning , basic promotion matters , management of urban properties , municipal business courtyard with architecture and urban gardens as well as Untere Baurechtsbehörde , including monument protection .	-6.7344
Bicycle thrown on lines : South Railway Locked	-3.3599
According to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the area of Leobener Stra<unk>e ( B116 ) .	-3.8181
They were so damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-3.2200
The investigators start from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-3.3989
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed near the town .	-4.1986
" This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich " , said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA .	-3.5228
The perpetrators or the perpetrators would have put themselves at great risk and would also have put trains at risk .	-3.9109
In addition to the damage to the lok and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of the railway replacement transport , railway customers could also pass on to the perpetrators .	-5.7406
All in all , the speaker said ' considerable ' sum .	-4.8918
The damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , and rail transport on the south railway could be carried out without disabilities .	-4.3534
Almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning , two of them concerned distance transport .	-4.0916
Freight trains did not fall , but they were late .	-10.1446
According to <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch , around 200 meters of transmission had to be exchanged .	-3.7720
Isolators and masts have also been damaged .	-1.5410
Red meat , milk products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory intestinal disease )	-2.2931
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.4648
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases .	-2.8899
The incurable state affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and blows , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-3.4370
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinlililililililililililili	-8.5773
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the intestinal to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate into the body .	-3.7336
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-2.8555
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation , it can result in inflammatory intestinal disease .	-2.9130
Experiments found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their infections .	-4.8943
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-2.8102
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-2.7685
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells " .	-2.2977
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal ilieus , if the same system also applies to people .	-4.2005
The post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mouse had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but which was separately housed , did not have this . liin lililililililililili	-8.8528
She suspected that the difference with the darmicrobiomas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-3.3341
The intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA and six bacterial types were found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing from the mice .	-3.8894
Mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lacked a darmicrobiom and they did not develop this type of immune cell , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-3.3480
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immune cells isolated by the mice .	-9.5863
Immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells li.	-7.2632
When the active component was cleaned from liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 milk acid .	-3.1967
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when the tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.3699
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.5709
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in people as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-3.5165
She said : ' The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.0174
Potentially , high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . '	-3.3710
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic	-2.6984
At Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes that after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.4379
The 40 million pound signature from Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward as they like .	-4.5088
However , Matic was excluded from the preparatory Asian tour of the blues and created only 45 minutes , adding Mourinho that he had to improve before the Premier League season began .	-3.8584
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.8611
'We will help him to be sooner than later . '	-2.4075
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season .	-3.4397
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic work " to fulfil three of his four priority new commitments .	-3.9190
" Three out of four , I thank the association , " he added .	-2.8619
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . '	-3.9928
Boeing " Paints " Dreamliners in the Sky	-2.4971
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.5890
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner across the US , which are several thousand kilometres .	-4.0309
The action took 18 hours and one minute .	-1.9893
The radar screens were the shape of a dreamliner .	-2.9990
The whole thing was a stamina test for new engines .	-2.0316
Boeing had previously made such advertising .	-10.1170
The number " 787 " and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .	-2.5826
New Play for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a Problem	-3.2622
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-3.7749
Just no fault from the party centre , no headwind from the Federal Government - that was the most important desire of the electoral campaigners .	-5.9323
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.6421
Since then , staff from the Willy Brandt House have been monitoring the events in the SPD-ruled capitals with growing horror .	-10.6070
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described as a headwind .	-3.4097
They were deep .	-2.3123

After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against SPD and Green coalitions .	-2.7924
" This shows once again : Red Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.1689
The surprising group outcome of a Green Member has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.3595
Five months before the landday election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.2139
The Green Managing Director , Michael Kellner , has asked Mrs Elke Twesten to return her mandate .	-3.6034
Transfer to the CDU means a clear distortion of voter will .	-3.0667
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and Campaign Director of the Greens to the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-9.8897
" All this must not be true " , a SPD campaigner sights when the new hiob message reaches the party centre on Friday morning .	-4.5974
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the transfer of the green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU without a majority of his own government .	-4.6397
It is the provisional highlight of a whole range of major and small crises in SPD associations .	-9.5017
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.5048
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat of the Saarland election in March .	-9.8461
A blue eye , no longer , reassured the comrades at the time .	-3.4492
After the farm elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.4993
It became - and everything became much worse .	-3.8467
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the dead , the Düsseldorf default smoothly killed the party .	-4.5422
In the weeks after that , the comrades were effortlessly rapped up again .	-6.4534
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-2.8268
And with him came the next depth .	-2.0338
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus at that weekend because he sat in Elbphilharmonie while burning his city .	-3.5672
And because he made everything wrong in crisis communications afterwards .	-3.5904
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for its political survival .	-1.9208
So now also Stephan Weil .	-2.2012
Due to the VW exhaust crisis and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for some time .	-9.4231
These poll values were added .	-2.0536
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Because in the last few weeks , it has been increasingly attempting to put emphasis on the federal government .	-6.3171
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained unconcealed in the environment of Martin Schulz .	-4.2571
They were able to grant him because they promised to stabilize the party from time to time .	-3.9771
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.4803
Because the internal dispute between the Lower Saxon Greens is basically no fault .	-4.3336
And Schulz is not at all .	-2.1140
For the time being , the composers are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-4.1890
Their anger is aimed at the Greens , and here in particular at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten .	-3.8645
" It is intolerable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-7.4366
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the Lower Saxon Green List , the Lower Saxon Member continues .	-4.1058
The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .	-1.8016
Thomas Oppermann , leader of the SPD Group , complains about an " undemocratic maneuver " .	-3.1369
" The willingness to vote four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-4.0032
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result , " said Oppermann further .	-3.5982
He called for the background to be clarified .	-1.7551
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony .	-3.1422
Funding for Central III	-2.9756
Anyone who wants to renovate his house over the years can soon receive support from the country .	-4.5116
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung on Wednesday in Empfingen .	-3.5093
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far .	-2.8115
Since 1991 there have been refurbishment areas in receptions .	-3.5234
At that time , in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the sum of funding .	-4.0758
From 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 percent in the recovery area II .	-4.7302
For Schindler , previous rehabilitation is a " success project " - it is also important to promote interior development and not just to open up new construction areas .	-5.1367
On 4 April , the President of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a remediation area III .	-3.8710
The sum of funding amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the community receptions .	-3.8603
What is the result of a refurbishment area ?	-3.4665
You will examine where the " really old " houses are .	-3.7846
However , it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to restore .	-4.1651
If necessary , the territorial boundaries could also move again .	-4.2383
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.7302
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Social City Programme , in which the rehabilitation would then be carried out .	-4.3615
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities , improvement of housing and working conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure .	-3.9355
The measures would be implemented object-related , i.e. per property .	-3.3205
The remediation area would then be defined as a statute .	-13.2712
The authorisation period for funding has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-3.0191
However , until September this year , the inventory would first be carried out , in which the parties involved in the recovery area would receive a questionnaire .	-5.9106
In November or December the Articles of Association shall take place as much as possible , so that next year we can start rehabilitation .	-5.6364
Pietzschmann then declared that every local authority must carry out the pre-examinations .	-4.7334
It is a question of assessing urban maladministration and deciding when to reconstruct and to what extent .	-4.0084
A refurbishment note will be entered in the land book for the respective property .	-5.2556
Pietzschmann himself will come back to receptions and take a picture of the situation , she promised .	-3.8678
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the participation of the parties involved .	-3.1843
Therefore , there will be questionnaires that will be postal to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .	-4.3127
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and plot arch " , which includes building conditions and refurbishment intentions .	-4.3121
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and housing sheet " , information on size , division and residents of a housing space can be provided .	-10.4111
The blue " operating sheet " is only to be filled in if business premises are operated in the building .	-10.6583
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding .	-3.3895
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .	-2.7756
Schindler still emphasized that the distribution of funds in accordance with the " greyhound principle " works - who comes first grinds first .	-4.9664
You cannot ' reserve ' funds later .	-3.5233
Finally , photos of the project " Local II " were shown to make the present a refurbishment " tasty " .	-4.4293
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car	-8.6849
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-3.0693
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and point fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-3.4811
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-3.2373
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.1569
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional charge of $ 300 per castpar.	-12.8336
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is on the tax .	-10.0842
The White House ’ s Advertising Costs the Taxpayer Thousands	-2.3002
The White House ’ s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American production last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 according to the military ’ s indications given to the TIME magazine .	-3.6728
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programmes .	-3.0684
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and White House officials toured products from all 50 countries .	-2.3887
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire brigade from Wisconsin and a fork truck from Mississippi .	-3.3852
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.3718
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " the commander of HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-3.4781
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17th at 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m. and until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-4.3925
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be required to fly back due to the restriction of service hours .	-4.1945
The original crew was held at the helicopter during the helicopter event , while the unit security staff remained on the ground during the period .	-11.7070
The recordings made available by the TIME did not make it clear whether a second crew was requirlinked .	-9.6370
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.1397
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-2.5423
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-2.9113
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the deputy commander answered .	-2.8884
The event " Made in America " was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-3.3178
But official events also have political overtones .	-2.0601
At the event , the President gave a boost to the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he promoted the efforts to curb government rules .	-4.3685
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.6336
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.1140
But requesting their use only for a photo op is unusual .	-2.7504
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors .	-3.7261
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made in America " - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , " said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.2768
HMX-1 occupations often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to dismantle US presidents in the White House with precise centimeter rates .	-3.8569
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings in the White House .	-2.7375
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted during the training needs of the crew for the month , said a official .	-3.5013
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-2.6564
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other requisites presented at the event .	-2.6264
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.5306
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact cost of the event .	-11.0678
According to hourly tariffs of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year , however , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour .	-9.6242
Records of the unit recorded the aircraft ’ s flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.6972
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .	-2.2505
" The cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.3180
'These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-2.7590
According to a 2015 RAND study , DoD ’ s refund rates do not include staff costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-7.0525
At that time , the former press spokesman of the White House , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-2.4231
" The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , " said Spicer .	-1.9894
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of contributing to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people , depend on it .	-13.6839
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.2677
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise that . '	-2.5876
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he placed himself in the driver ’ s seat of a fire brigade .	-3.4065
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products .	-2.3644
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.2868
TC BW Neuss Before Tricky Task	-2.3185
Top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga starts at the Table Third Suchsdorfer SV .	-5.0769
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the Table Third Suchsdorfer SV .	-4.3468
Despite five games , the leader of the Second Tennis League has maintained the sense of reality .	-4.5334
Team chef Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-8.6256
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .	-2.5166
I find the team very good , especially in the rear positions . ' ... ............ .........	-12.0893
Class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV mainly provide imports from the high north .	-3.6993
" Their Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup .	-2.2054
And they are also strong in double , " says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-2.7833
" As always , this becomes difficult for us .	-2.6187
You also need a good portion of luck . '	-2.4155
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north is practical .	-2.7530
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier .	-12.1281
If the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it the Bundesliga game , the Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the Czech Liberec tournament will be his first bet in this season .	-6.2109

How America Can Damage OMV	-2.0611
Really happy , Donald Trump did not work when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten up sanctions against Russia .	-10.0037
" In his hast to enact the law , " Congress has packaged some " unconstitutional rules " , he estimated .	-3.9953
The response from Moscow was also as sharp as expected , and even Brussels foamed against the US advance .	-10.8220
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-2.6139
Accordingly , investors of domestic OMV have been worried since then , co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea management Nord Stream 2 with other European companies .	-4.6886
The threat is huge .	-1.9716
Nevertheless , if it were too early for an assessment of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .	-3.6131
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring sanctions to life by executive order .	-3.1438
Twelve weapons are at his disposal .	-2.4918
" The press " has looked at which the Group could defend and which could really blow him .	-4.1831
Narcos Season 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel is put into the centre of the Netflix hit series .	-3.9957
Despite the second season of Narcos , which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.6884
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show .	-3.3018
With the third season , the DEA has drawn its attention to the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali cartel .	-2.9897
Led by four powerful governments , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribes and violent actions .	-2.9485
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.2460
In the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<unk>a , the type inviting American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs .	-2.8165
Other new actors include Matias Varela , Michael Stahl-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-1.7723

Role Backwards : The City Adjusts 46 Kitchen Aids	-3.9280
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself .	-3.0036
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .	-3.3810
The clock is turned back in urban children 's day centres .	-3.8836
On September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in urban children ’ s daytime facilities ( kitas ) again in its own direction .	-5.4770
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Head of Youth Assistance , this is a good news : " We have all been very pleased " .	-3.6567
Cooked is still out of the house : a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooled cooked .	-4.2049
The city operates 46 children ’ s day-care centres in the Krefeld area , and in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time .	-4.9157
In the last kita year , 2,800 children were at the tables , and needs are growing steadily .	-4.0976
" Meanwhile not only children who are cared for 45 weekly hours , in the kita for lunch , " explains Pomeranz .	-4.3713
" The offer also applies in 35-hour care when children remain until 14 : 00 " .	-4.0021
46 part-time forces have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered meals , complement them with salad , raw fruit and raw fruit , portion the meal individually , spend the food , clean off , rinse and clean the kitchen .	-5.4728
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pomeranz .	-2.7142
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides on the scope of the hour .	-3.6978
" The kitchen helpers belong firmly to the kita team " , says Pommeranz satisfies .	-3.4002
" They are much more involved in this way and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the management of kitals " .	-4.3695
This is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-2.8673
" Children should help prepare food " .	-2.4219
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .	-3.1180
Also for the children .	-7.7249
" They have a known force in the kita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-2.8799
This continuity is important for children .	-1.4544
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning staff .	-4.4202
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen service , this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in comparison with the cost of self-government and foreign award for the city , it is called the press office .	-6.7283
And that , although 46 part-time forces are re-employed .	-3.0471
" But these hours are not so strong in the educational sector for about 750 people , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-4.4154
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN	-6.8068

" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said on Wednesday in a statement .	-2.0092
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.6170
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.0576
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .	-13.7773
This year , for the first time , the elections will hand over power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next .	-2.5998
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan ’ s democratic success .	-1.9691

Men Try to Exploit 13-year-old Girl	-3.8368
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to deprive a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .	-2.6720
According to information from the police , the men addressed the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on the Kolpingstra<unk>e at 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to call with the girl 's mobile phone .	-5.0789
But the 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with their friends .	-3.1439
Afterwards , one of the perpetrators tried to use the mobile phone and necklace of the girl , but this failed .	-13.1718
Without prey , the duo fled .	-1.8708

The investigations are under way .	-1.7648
GMB concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-1.9249
A trade union wants to ensure that McVitie is managed by the biscuit manufacturer about the long-term commitment to production at her plant in Glasgow .	-4.1690
GMB Scotland said that the company has silenced about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-2.4388
More than 500 employees work in the factory , which manufactures hobnobs and rich tea biscuits alongside other products .	-3.2317
McVities owner Pladis said that he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-2.0803
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be ' first experienced ' if their activities were to change .	-8.1692
In a letter to the company ’ s head office , GMB Scotland McVitie ’ s called on ' to express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being driven forward ' .	-4.6573
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot clarify the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply .	-2.9702
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce focus strongly on the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-3.7202
Therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising living costs and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie " .	-4.1008
A spokesman from Pladis said : " The head of staff at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-4.5771
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-2.6526
We discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - to remain competitive . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , ,	-14.3295
She added : " In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-2.6416

Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago about Neymar ?	-1.9683
The La Liga side may regret her interest in Marco Verratti	-2.2566
Paris Saint-Germain will not fall in her persecution of Neymar after having made an offer of $ 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record raid ?	-3.6971
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .	-3.5871
After finishing , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world .	-3.4345
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced his way outside , although a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013 .	-3.9023
But has the football world been warned three years ago by the PSG president against this prospect ?	-8.4476
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every association that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.1515
" I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.7051
" We respect all clubs .	-0.9331
But if you try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . '	-3.1358
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG medium field player Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-3.5559
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-3.4511

On Thursday evening , the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 7.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau was on the way to Leese .	-3.9115
In the field of local circumvention of Stolzenau , a car was received from him on his track so that he had to avoid the right .	-6.0158
The Touran driver touched the guide .	-3.4919
Property damage was caused by the car .	-4.0565
The driver of the accommodating car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident .	-3.4484
According to the accident damaged , it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all .	-3.5123
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter pays vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under phone 05761 / 92060 .	-3.6058
Interview : " Domspatzen report relieves Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger "	-2.4143
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Popst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger .	-2.7718
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.6907
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg dom spats continues to ensure discussions .	-3.6573
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects the former bishop of Regensburg and today ’ s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.3762
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own omissions or their false assessment of what happened then .	-4.2599
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized the measurement of " two standards " in the reporting of violence in the dom spats .	-5.0837
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that these are ' disgraceful and shameful acts ' that should be punished and prevented in the future ; but noticeable is the ' degree of medial manipulation ' , including the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee .	-4.4812
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider that normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-3.2569
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also meant in the interview with the Bavarian broadcasting : " They like to go to the church and this is a found food " .	-4.5095
She also pointed out that in her youth " blows were a normal pedagogical means " to cope with friendly children , as I was one , " .	-13.0229
It would be unfair to apply today 's standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.4761
Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared in connection with the reports on abuses .	-3.2044
Wrongly , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-3.2697
" I must protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he evaluates the results of the final report .	-2.9601
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who was authorised by Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-4.4791
A total of 547 Regensburg dom spats were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 dom spats .	-3.6126
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In summary , it is possible to state that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were applied by Domkapellmeister R.	-11.4956
Especially with high emotionality , punishment for the pupils could also be more violent .	-4.2372
Nevertheless , unlike many other accused persons , it is noticeable that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even link positive memories with him ' .	-4.7841
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves him .	-4.1827
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' exercise of violence in protective orders in the Regensburg dom spats ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.3355
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " . literlililililililililililililili	-8.5606
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist , who often became hand-crafted when a domspatz did not bring top performance to the musical .	-6.2365
How do you regard this final report as his biograph ?	-2.2570
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you need to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger even occurs in it .	-5.3843
He is dedicated just eight pages and is clearly released from any suspicion of complicity or co-science in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.1338
The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of effect .	-2.9903
He may be accused of learning too late or of not taking first suggestions seriously enough .	-4.4041
The Catholic Gymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-4.6415
Thus , the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger issues an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understandable " , as extremely good teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and candies and " always surrounded by grapes of children " .	-9.7328
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which has already led to anger .	-3.3910
He himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized that he did not only break with chairs and threw the key covenant onto the ground , but also distributed ear figs and too free boys to the hair or ears .	-6.9637
However , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question , the 1960s and the 1970s , parents and teachers .	-4.7697
Do you also know such customization methods ?	-3.2606
Of course , I think everyone who was born before 1968 .	-7.2813
I , too , have seen this in a secular school , a state school .	-11.1248
These are , however , bagatelles compared to what this report is about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school .	-4.1053
As one wonders whether it has to do with his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him .	-6.2516
After all , many who have never understood him still work diligently on the Bavarian Pope .	-3.6015
The truth , however , is that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-10.2971
In the media , a great deal has been said about the misuse of the Regensburg dom spats in connection with the report .	-4.1799
Will Georg Ratzinger be burdened in the final report with any involvement or science regarding sexual abuse ?	-3.7336
Michael Hesemann : Very clearly no linelilililililililililili	-7.1189
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Cathedral Chapel .	-3.1315
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.2010
" I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " one stakeholder said , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-4.1071
The real problem with educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent .	-3.2595
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and sisters , then certainly not a choir conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in some cases .	-10.6867
How do the Dom Spatzen students rate Ratzinger 's role in terms of cases of abuse ? ? ?..	-10.4935
Michael Hesemann : A surveyed student said : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) could have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator .	-4.3841
I think it is also really absurd to assume that it is precisely him ... Bubs have opened up more urgent or clearer or even more rather than their parents , boarding managers , trust teachers , etc .	-6.5517
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.3516
The report therefore comes to the very clear result : ' The fact that students and / or their environment entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation ' .	-4.7352
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any science .	-3.4285
Thus , he cannot be accused of not preventing him or making him list.	-9.9338
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these reluctant crimes , as happened in some cases , unfortunately .	-3.6640
In the media there was much to read about " violence excesses " at the Regensburg Cathedral .	-4.2733
The former domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of in the report ' Wegschauen ' .	-3.7177
Does he have to live with this charge ?	-2.3119
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that has mixed everything in reporting and confused into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.4347
But that is precisely what the report is abusing .	-3.5985
There is a clear separation between the pre-school and the school of the dom spats , between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-4.3296
The report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the dom spats .	-4.5768
The whole terrible education , the cases where sadistic teachers were really harassed and painted and suffered from it , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where really scandalous conditions had to prevail .	-5.8246
But with those , Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already on the dom spat gymnasium .	-4.7400
On that , as most witnesses point out , the topic " pre-school " was taboo .	-2.9689
It was only happy to escape it and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even " paradise " states .	-11.2851
What was different on the Catholic Gymnasium ?	-3.1561
Michael Hesemann : There was already discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-2.5504
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even link positive memories to him despite violence ' .	-4.1800
That is how the maximum charge remains to have looked away .	-4.3335
However , despite all the efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported of the conditions at the pre-school .	-4.1131
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and did not want to hear anything from the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible , and then around 1993 .	-5.1696
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the states ?	-7.6863
Michael Hesemann : No , because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.3710
He points out to them that ' the caning penalty will continue to be practised in pre-school ' .	-4.4555
He recommended urgent intervention in view of the danger of negative press releases .	-2.8926
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity when caning penalties were long prohibited in Bavaria .	-3.5690
Before that , they happened in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-11.4264
It was difficult for him to assess where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit was really exceeded .	-5.1673
But one cannot say that he always looked away .	-3.1056
That is simply not true .	-1.3900
Only in 1980 was the official abolition of caning at schools in Bavaria .	-2.5863
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today 's educational standards to the time .	-2.8841
How do you see this ?	-1.3239
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " fallstrick of anachronism " , in other words the danger of assessing the past according to moral standards today .	-3.8523
The Prince is right .	-2.1510
But , of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abhorrent at all times , nor to what was crimed in the pre-school of innocent child souls , which goes far beyond the usual one at that time .	-5.5852
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being processed .	-3.5378
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all of this had nothing to do with him .	-2.8689
His means of disciplining and punishing , in other words slaps and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-4.4677
When physical punishment was banned , he was also strictly respected .	-3.9642
What picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger given in the talks with you for the book " My Brother of the Pope " ?	-7.6886
Did the issue of caning penalty also mention this ?	-4.9450
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , since the dom spats played only a side role .	-3.8410
Nevertheless , I do not at all conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.0758
However , this must also be said : without this perfectionism , without demanding absolute discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world ranking from the rather nationally known Regensburg domes , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-5.6351
With biscuits and candles alone , one does not make major singers and every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-6.2448
What kind of people have you experienced during the talks on their book ?	-3.8146
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced over and over again as a wonderful , humorous , fundamental , deeply believing and heartfelt people who cannot imagine he could do something to suffer even one fly .	-6.1626
I regularly get in touch with how many former dom spats still today , 23 years after his emerition , regularly keep in touch with him , visit him , read it out - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-4.6644
Those who still do not forgive him that he was strict to them are clearly in the minority .	-3.6900
Most dom spats are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music .	-3.3941
And that he was always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a loving respect person to whom they still look up today and whom they worship .	-5.0984
And please be quite clear once again : all that is accused of him are educational methods that were then on the agenda .	-4.3589
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-2.2341
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media scapegoat .	-2.8483
The evil intention behind this is all too obvious .	-2.5819
The report which has just been published relieves it .	-2.4595
Now the decency would require a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merit , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , no one would finally know the Regensburg dom spats .	-5.1586
