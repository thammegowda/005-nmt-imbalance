Welsh Ageorders take care ' to look like Dödel '	-5.1582
There is consternation among some Members of the Assembly about a proposal to change their title to MWP ( Member of the Welsh Parliament ) .	-4.2036
The reason for this was plans to change the name of the National Assembly in Welsh Parliament .	-2.9983
Members of all parties to the National Assembly have concerns that they might expose themselves to ridicule .	-4.0005
A Labour MEP said that his group ' rhymes with Twp and Pwp ' .	-2.7416
Note to the reader : “ twp ” in Welsh means “ fired ” and “ pwp ” means “ plug ” .	-3.9724
A meeting member of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole is " not happy " and has proposed alternatives .	-2.4947
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was “ open ” to a change in name , but pointed out that from “ MWP ” ( a member of the Welsh Parliament ) it was just a verbal leap to “ Muppet . ”	-5.5543
Note : The Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar manner to U in English .	-4.6415
The National Assembly ’ s Commission , which is currently working on a bill for change of name , said : “ The final decision on the designation of members of the National Assembly naturally lies with the members themselves . ”	-5.4659
The Government of Wales Act 2017 enabled the Welsh Parliament to change its name .	-1.7217
In June last year , the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals for a change in the name in the Welsh Parliament .	-4.2708
On the issue of the title of the meeting members , the Commission preferred Welsh MPs or WMPs , but the VAT option received most support in a public consultation .	-4.2463
Members of the Welsh Parliament seem to be proposing alternative options , but the fight to reach a consensus may be a headache for Chairman Elin JONES , who is expected to submit a bill for these changes in the coming weeks .	-4.8595
The legislation on reforms will involve changes in the way the Assembly operates , including the rules governing disqualification of Members of the Welsh Parliament and the organisation of the committee system .	-6.3116

Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the country 's name .	-2.6963
On Sunday , the eligible voters will vote on the amendment of the country ’ s name to the “ Republic of Northern Macedonia ” .	-4.4120
The referendum is being held in order to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece , in which a province is called Macedonia .	-3.6468
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to its application for membership of the EU and NATO .	-4.0226
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on the change of name , has said that he will ignore the vote .	-3.0027
But the referendum ’ s supporters , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO .	-3.7425
The bells of St. Martin are ringing because churches in Harlem have problems .	-4.0757
" Historically , the old people with whom I spoke said that there was a bar and a church at every corner , " said Mr Adams .	-3.7523
" Today there is neither . "	-2.0853
He said that the disappearance of pubs is understandable .	-1.6110
" People make comets in a different way , " he said today .	-3.3165
'Pubs are no longer a living room in the neighbourhood where you meet regularly ' .	-4.1227

Churches could be replaced by multi-family houses with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the district ’ s remaining es es es es . es es es es es es es es es es es es es	-7.6190
The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be aware , he said , ' and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are closed completely , as it is unlikely that most of those people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches ' .	-6.3999
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became the black metropolis in 1870 – Metropolitan Community , St. Martin 's a decade later .	-2.9295
The original white Methodist community withdrew in the 1930s .	-2.7177
The building was bought by a black community that had a religion nearby .	-5.3729
St. Martin 's was taken over by a black community under the priest John Howard Johnson , who led a boycott of retailers on 125 Street , a main street for shopping in Harlem , which opposed the recruitment or promotion of blacks .	-6.1243
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged , but when the parish members of Father Johnson made plans for reconstruction , they attributed the chimera .	-4.6325
Father David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin 's , proudly called the Glockenspiel " the bells of the poor . "	-3.4664
The expert who played the bell game in July called it something else : " A cultural treasure " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument " .	-3.9743
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also found that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who changed 18 years ago to the bigger bell game on the Riverside Church .	-4.8526
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace him .	-1.6218
What has happened to St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors , some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese .	-6.0894
The sacristy – the head of the parish , made up of lay leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with the concern that the diocese " would try to pass on the costs to the sacristy " , even though the sacristy was not involved in appointing the architects and contractors of the diocese .	-5.9113
Some community members complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese .	-3.0101

On Saturday , a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while he appeared in California on the opening day of the lobster season , officials said .	-3.8357
The attack took place just before seven in the morning near the beach of Beacon in Eninitas .	-3.4622
Chad Hammel said KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help , and he was then patched with the others to save him from the water .	-6.6083
“ First I thought someone was happy because he caught a lobster , ” said Hammel , but then I noticed that someone shouted : “ I was bitten ! ”	-4.6898
I was bitten !	-1.6529
Hammel said that he found this when he came to the boy .	-5.1593
I shouted at everyone to get out of the water : " There is a shark in the water ! " said Hammel .	-3.3325
The boy was brought to the Rady Children 's Hospital in San Diego , where his condition was documented as critical .	-2.8388
The shark responsible for the attack is unknown .	-1.2889
Rescue swim captain Larry Giles said in a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier , but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark .	-4.7030
Giles added traumatic injury to the upper body of his victim .	-2.7067
Officials closed the access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami 's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons .	-2.9940

Sainsbury is planning to conquer the British beauty market .	-1.8971
Sainsbury 's takes over Boots , Superdrug and Debenhams with shelves of department style beauty products , which are filled with specialist assistants .	-4.5786
As part of an extensive push to the UK beauty market , which continues to grow and is worth $ 2.8bn , fashion and homeware sales will fall behind .	-5.4713
The idea of investing in the beauty market was born out of the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the Regal Square , which used to be used for television , microwave and household goods , for new products .	-6.0435
Sainsbury announced that the range of beauty products will be doubled to 3000 products , including brands such as Revlon , Essie , Tweezers and Dr. PawPaw .	-4.4028
Existing collections of L 'Oreal , Maybelline and Burt 's Bees will also have more space in branded areas , similar to those found in shops such as Boots .	-5.2522
The supermarket chain also revives its own brand “ boutique ” , which has many popular vegan products on offer among young buyers .	-5.6269
In addition , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop is testing concessions in two Sainsbury 's shops , the first of which was opened last week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year is opened in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-4.5252
Online shopping and a shift to daily purchases of small quantities of food in neighborhood stores mean that supermarkets have to do more to get people to visit .	-4.8926
Mike Coupe , the boss of Sainsbury 's , has said that outlets will increasingly look like department stores , as the supermarket chain tries to combat discounters like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-4.1021
Sainsbury 's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , supposedly boosting food sales and making acquisitions more profitable .	-4.0529
The previous attempt by the supermarket to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended with a failure .	-2.9032
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s , but it ended unetschieden , and revenue from pharmacies ’ shops could not be shared .	-4.6095
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold his 281 store pharmacy business three years ago for <unk> 125 million to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain .	-4.2079
According to Lloyds , the range of luxury skin care products from brands such as La Roche-Trommy and Vichy is to be extended to four Lloyds stores .	-8.4072
Paul Mills-Hicks , Sainsbury ’ s advertising manager , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our plastic shelves to improve equipment for our customers .	-5.5053
In addition , we have invested in the training of employees to advise the customer .	-4.5330
Our brand portfolio leaves nothing to be desired .	-2.6759

The This Morning presenter announced on Instagram that she will go .	-3.0314

The business was compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow , and it was assumed that it would double Willoughby ’ s assets of an estimated <unk> 11 million .	-4.4470
When Willoughby , 37 , announced on Instagram that she would leave True , Jones left Britain and flew to one of his homes .	-3.6306
One source said , " It was really high on Holly 's list of priorities . "	-3.3283
It should be its long-term future and secure it for the next few decades .	-4.9772

Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday – just before the start .	-2.5489
" At Marlow HQ there is a warehouse full of goods that can be sold . "	-2.7773

And it could mean the end of a long friendship .	-1.7291
Willoughby and his husband , Dan Baldwin , Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been close by for ten years .	-2.6363
Willoughby founded True with Capp in 2016 and Jones , 52 , in March .	-5.1752
The couples go on holiday together and Jones has a 40 % stake in Baldwin ’ s TV production company .	-3.6900

More than three months after the June summit in Singapore , Ri Yong Ho , North Korea 's leading diplomat , told United Nations leaders on Saturday that the North does not see a " corresponding response " from the US to North Korea 's early disarmament efforts .	-4.1448

Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his presidential speech .	-4.0369
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.3715
“ We wanted to wage war with North Korea .	-1.7231
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.8630
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-1.6282
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results , such as ending missile tests , freeing hostages , and transferring the remains of American soldiers home .	-3.8000
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim .	-2.9185
" It 's so easy to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this packed arena , about 200 people would be there , " Trump said , pointing to the crowd in front of him .	-4.5762
In Indonesia , a tsunami and an earthquake kill hundreds and devastate an island .	-1.2373
After the earthquake in Lombok , for example , foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed .	-2.7011
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok were displaced , no national disaster was declared , a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid .	-3.9321

While Save the Children assemble a team to travel to Palu , it is not yet certain that foreign staff can work on the spot .	-4.4536
The spokesman for the national civil protection agency , Mr Sutolo , said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations can contribute to the relief effort .	-4.4462
Unfortunately , given the earthquake that Indonesia is constantly suffering , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-4.6667
While the tsunami classrooms were built in Aceh , which is not common for other coastal lines .	-5.0364
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning sire in Palu , although a warning was already in force , may have contributed to the loss of human life .	-4.1662

The statue of Cromwell ’ s Parliament will mark the recent historic success of the History series .	-4.7731
His exile would be poetic justice for his taliban-like destruction of so many of England ’ s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers .	-3.4540
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick 's proposal as " folly " and as an " attempt to rewrite history . "	-3.2864
John Goldsmith , chairman of Cromwell Society , said , “ Given the current debate about the removal of statues , it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell ’ s figure would be targeted at the Westminster Palace . ”	-3.7235
The storm of the English civil war was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell .	-4.0038
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century .	-3.4913
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft ’ s magnificent account of Cromwell bears witness to the view that prevailed in the 19th century , and that still prevails in parts of history : that Cromwell is worth celebrating .	-5.8220
Mr Goldsmith said on the Sunday Telegraph : ‘ Cromwell is regarded by many , perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today , as a defender of Parliament against external pressure , in his case , of course , the monarchy .	-5.0095
Whether this is absolutely correct representation is the subject of the ongoing historical debate .	-3.1518
This is certain : the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century shaped the subsequent development of our nation , and Cromwell is an individual figure that stands for one side of the divide .	-4.5686
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth remembering and celebrating . ”	-2.6473

Captain Halkett provided an excellent level of defense , while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on trot all the time .	-6.2352
However , the Rangers lacked ideas .	-2.0372
As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard , they fell far behind these standards .	-3.2116

These demands arose after US government officials made announcements about AI , though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-4.0518
Meanwhile , China unveiled its plan last year : by 2030 , it will be the number 1 in AI innovation .	-3.7674
“ Doubling spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries lag far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is imminent , ” Lee said .	-4.1439
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next artificial intelligence achievement will be achieved in the US , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.0204
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the New World Order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of China ’ s best-known AI firms , Face + + .	-3.5730
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated America ’ s highest ranked Othello player , and later served as executive at Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s Chinese branch .	-6.5804
Lee has recognized the US government ’ s earlier technology contests , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , and asked when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-3.9105
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain government subsidies , ” Lee said .	-2.7686
“ It is not China that is responsible for the outflow of senior scientists , but companies , ” Lee noted .	-3.5604
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have hired university luminaries to work on AI in recent years .	-3.2629
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-3.1559
“ I think Green Cards should automatically be offered PhD students in AI , ” he said .	-2.8654
In July 2017 , the Chinese State Council presented its next generation artificial intelligence development plan ( Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan ) .	-3.3829

Earlier this year , the US Department of Defense has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center , which is to involve industry and science partners , and the White House has announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-4.6665
And this month , DARPA announced an investment of $ 2 billion in an initiative called “ AI Next . ”	-2.6284
As far as the NSF is concerned , it is currently investing more than $ 100 million a year in AI research .	-2.1367
Meanwhile , US legislation , which sought to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence , has been dead for months .	-5.4325
Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether the country 's name should be changed .	-7.6574
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed in the ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step which would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece , which had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-4.6957
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that its northern neighbor ’ s name represents a territorial claim to the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country ’ s entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.8090
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia .	-2.8399
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum , and in the face of a boycott campaign , there is doubt as to whether the result will create the 50 % threshold , which is a prerequisite for the referendum to be valid .	-5.5707
The question on the ballot paper on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.8981
Advocates of the change of name , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth the price of continuing admission to institutions like the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.6933
“ I have come here today to vote on the future of the country , it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.7209
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it decisive .	-3.6724
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament .	-2.2714
At around 1 p.m. , the Committee on the Land Election said that there were no reports of irregularities .	-5.6973
But voter turnout was only 16 % – at the same time , 34 % in the last 2016 general election , and 66 % of registered voters ended up voting .	-4.5538
“ I went to vote for my children – our place is in Europe , ” Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-3.3617
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son Dushko , voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the country ’ s name , which would pave the way for him to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.8352
In front of the Skopje Parliament , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , has prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set by those who are going to boycott the referendum .	-4.0016
" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads up , not through the door of service , " said Kavadarkov .	-2.9860
“ We live in a poor country , but we too have our dignity .	-1.8917
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.8906
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.0282
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” stated Zaev after giving his vote .	-4.2768
According to him , the outcome would be “ yes ” to a “ strengthening of our future . ”	-4.3073
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a poll : between 30 and 43 % of voters would participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-3.1001
Another poll conducted by Macedonia 's Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.9204
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said they would vote ‘ yes ’ .	-4.0403
The referendum will be adopted only if the turnout is over 50 % .	-6.3996
A referendum failure would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government ’ s policy since it took office last May .	-3.9015
Prestigious : Manchester City ’ s Sergio Agüero overcomes the entire Brighton defense on his way to the gate .	-6.1967
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling did Brighton 's defense in the Manchester City 2 / 0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-4.4487
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look incredibly simple .	-5.1564
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine striker received a pass in the middle field .	-3.4691
He won three of Brighton 's defenders to free himself .	-6.5379
Then Agüero was surrounded by three green shirts .	-2.3703
He crossed a defender before running away from several players on the fringe of the Brighton Penalty .	-6.5681
Then he made a pass to the left and handed down to Sterling .	-3.4047
The English striker used his first contact to play back the ball to Agüero , who then shot right – past Brightton-goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to the right side of the goal .	-5.3520
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City-Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters .	-2.4559
“ We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.4129
That has happened .	-1.3261
Fortunately , he scored a goal at the moment . ”	-3.3344
However , it was Sterling who first led the Sky Blues at the Premier League match :	-3.7014
The goal came in the 29th minute .	-1.9864
In the game Aguero was played the ball deep in the territory of Brighton .	-3.3325
with a nice steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side .	-2.0775
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the remote post .	-2.8079
The Sky Blues played the ball forward into the net before slipping out of the field .	-3.7386

Scherzer Wants to Play against Rockies	-4.1967
Since the national gambler was excluded from gambling competition , there was little reason to force another start .	-4.0752
But Scherzer is hoping to climb the hill against Colorado Rockies on Sunday , but only if there are Playoff implications for the Rockies , which have a lead from a game in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-5.5501
The Rockies secured at least one place ahead with a 5 : 2 victory over the national on Friday evening , but the title win in the first league is still not sure .	-5.1661
" Even if we play for free , we can at least get involved because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best we have to offer this year .	-5.0126
Why should I not want to make an effort ? '	-3.0365
The national teams have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to throw Scherzer in such a situation .	-5.6316
Scherzer , who would make his 34th start , threw up on Thursday and threw in his normal day of rest .	-4.9004

Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives .	-2.9202
This is one of the big , big - I 'm not running , but I 'm really running , so I fight everywhere for great candidates , he said .	-3.6305
Trump continues : “ You see this terrible , terrible radical democrat group , you see it happening right now .	-4.0739
And they are determined to regain power with all the necessary means , and they do not stop from malities and commonalities .	-7.0205
They do not care about who they hurt , whom they have to cross to gain power and control , that is what they want , power and control , we will not give it to them .	-5.4698
“ The Democrats ’ goal is to resist and block , ” he said .	-2.6976
" And you see this in the last four days , " he said , calling the democrats " angry and common , evil and untrue . "	-4.3042
“ He specifically referred to the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein , a senior member of the Senate ’ s Legal Affairs Committee , and thus received loud chorus from the audience .	-5.6747
" Do you remember your answer ?	-1.6936
Have you read the document ?	-1.1897
No , what .	-0.7279
No , ah no , I , moment – that was really bad body language – was the worst body language I have ever seen . ”	-3.2210
The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.9625
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.9107
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.0492
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs to say that we are not welcome , just because we have said our opinion .	-4.1430
My group colleague , Joan Ryan , has been treated in the same way because she has been resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism .	-4.5883
In my case , I have been criticised by the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.4729

The statement for the East Labour meeting in Nottingham on Friday says : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-3.7487
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP , the GC meeting on Friday evening was exactly the same .	-4.8843
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , gentler ' policy is long forgotten , if it has ever begun .	-3.8237
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and any opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to the Party leadership .	-4.2667
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s inauguration , because my colleagues , with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude , expected me to make a U-turn and adopt positions with which I would never otherwise have been able to agree , whether on national security or on the EU ’ s internal market .	-6.7662
Whenever I express myself publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a tirade of abuse in the social media that calls for rejection , denounces the centre ’ s policy and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-6.4753
This experience is not only my own .	-3.9886
I know , in fact , that there is more happiness than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political .	-4.4314
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are subjected every day to a flood of sexist or racist abuse , but never shy away .	-3.6083
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the level of abuse has normalized .	-2.1944
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.4319
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with any motion of censure or amendment of the rules of selection , the party is becoming smaller .	-4.8192
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years to collect my neck , not to be so vocal , and then I would be “ fine . ”	-4.9688
But that is why I have not come into politics .	-3.2341
32 years ago , I joined Labour as a student , because of the Thatcher-government ’ s neglect , which meant that my classroom had literally collapsed , and as a result I tried to work for better public services for those who need them most , whether as a municipal council or a minister .	-6.9655
I have never hidden my political views , even at the last election .	-2.8761
As far as my political positions are concerned , no one in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way ; the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.6093
To those who supported the motion on Friday , I just want to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that harms households , businesses , and our public services .	-4.5495
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham momentum , but about my constituents , whether Labour Members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not be deterred by threats to vote out or political opportunity from work in what I believe is the best interest of all of you .	-5.5322

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr unbeaten at the helm	-3.1818
Two late Tries may have distorted the final result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win this wonderfully entertaining Tennessee 's Premiership Match of the day .	-8.8319
They are now the only uncut of the ten teams running the table .	-3.9372
In the end , it was due to the outstanding defense of the host , but also to the fact that opportunities were better exploited .	-6.5080
" We have been tested so far by our games and we are still clumsy , so I have to be happy , " he said .	-4.1244
Robyn Christie of Melrose said , “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-3.0454
Grant Andersen ’ s 14 minute trial , awarded by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , given for the game of Warriders , allowed Melrose to speak , and Jason Baggot to give an unrepentant attempt .	-8.8553
Climo reached Ayr ’ s lead with a penalty beat before he scored a match right at the halfway point and then made a solo attempt to lead Ayr into the 17 : 5 break .	-9.0328
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to convert from Baggot reduced the lag to five points .	-4.4802
Ayr had a long break because of the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott , who left the field on a sling .	-8.1374
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and again Melrose paid the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt , at the end of a curse of intense pressure .	-4.3858
MacPherson was the first person to be elected to the National Assembly of Canada .	-16.2225
Climo converted , as almost immediately after the reboot , after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrongs Boxkick and sent the wyvern driver Gregor Henry via pass to Try number five .	-6.6073

Throughout Bolivia , the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century remains alive , as is the desire to return to the Pacific .	-4.1719
These hopes may be at their highest point in decades , as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultation .	-4.9978
" Bolivia has the dynamism , the spirit of unity and serenity and , of course , expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.6355
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country , and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will find Bolivia 's claim that , after decades of restless talks , Chile must negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-5.0580
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic Indian president – who will face a controversial re-election struggle next year – a very much depends on Monday ’ s decision .	-5.1263
“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he vowed at the end of August .	-3.0971
Some analysts , however , consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not bring about any change .	-3.9202
The Dutch UN agency has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-4.0880
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice only came about six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-4.3075
Far from driving Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years may have postponed it .	-3.3206
“ The question of sea access is being used by the current Bolivian Government for its purposes , ” said Zárate .	-3.4214
Morales ’ s belligerent rhetoric destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , proposed it .	-3.3153
Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at some point , but it will be difficult to continue the talks afterwards .	-3.8584
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962 .	-1.2680
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé , Bolivia ’ s representative in The Hague , rejected the idea that the court had decided unusually quickly .	-7.3414
Monday will offer Bolivia “ an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile , ” as well as an opportunity to “ put an end to 139 years of disagreements of mutual benefit , ” he said .	-7.2262
Calzadilla also denied that Morales , who remains one of Latin America ’ s most popular presidents , uses the issue of sea access politically for his purposes .	-3.5611
“ Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean , ” he added .	-1.4879

North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not come unless it can trust the US .	-1.9493
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington .	-3.3542
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday .	-1.7285
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit of the two rival leaders in Singapore .	-2.6352
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume the stalled diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament three months after meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in Singapore .	-3.4038
Ri says that it is “ a dream ” that sanctions will continue to be imposed and the US ’ s opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees .	-4.6967

Unpractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer , and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations over the catwalk .	-4.1400
The most important piece of Valentino was an overworked beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide border that flooded the heads of the models .	-5.1175
Other oversized accessories were watermelons with jewellery , a sorcerer 's hat and even a pineapple , but they are not meant to keep the head warm .	-3.9780
Thom Browne showed a number of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween .	-1.4266
Many of the colourful masks had come together and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Couture .	-4.1175

The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was sprayed over Social Media sent another great creation on the catwalk - a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the bathing suit model it wore .	-6.1942
The orange pack bag , filled with Raffia-Saum and with a white leather handle , was the outstanding piece in Jacques ' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week .	-6.3634

Independent schools in Scotland have a record track record of top academic excellence , which has continued in 2018 with outstanding results in their examinations , along with individual and group successes in sports , art , music , and other collaborative ventures .	-8.2676
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents .	-4.2819
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further education , including at universities , for their career , and for their role as world citizens .	-5.4727
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , noting that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools .	-5.1754
Nelson Mandela once said , “ When you talk to a person in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-3.9476
When you talk to him in his own language , it is his heart . ”	-3.9276
This is an impressive illustration of the fact that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries .	-3.6719
The results of this year 's audit show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest levels of attendance in independent schools .	-4.2694
68 % of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the “ Higher grade A ” higher grade A .	-5.0643
The data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of the students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while among the students who learned German , French and Spanish , 72 , 69 and 63 achieved a grade A .	-5.8014
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-3.0212
Language subjects have the same rank in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-4.3116
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Qualifications Commission found that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling job vacancies are due to a lack of language skills .	-5.4546
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-4.1563
With more promising employment opportunities that require languages , these skills are essential in a globalized world .	-3.7716
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he will have a real advantage in the future with a lifetime ability like this .	-5.0894
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad means that a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competition .	-3.6423
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to talk , and French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-8.8697
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today ’ s children .	-3.6682
When children learn to speak multiple languages – especially those of developing countries – they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the labor market .	-3.9204
Schools in Scotland are different in terms of their language supply   .	-5.4758
Some schools focus on the classic modern languages , while others will teach the most important languages for the UK in 2020 , such as Mandarin and Japanese .	-3.9577
Whatever your child ’ s interest , there will always be a number of languages available in independent schools , with teachers specializing in this field .	-8.1709
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that prepares children well , with the necessary tools for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-4.9196
In today ’ s global business world , languages remain undeniably important for the country ’ s future , and this must also be reflected in education .	-3.6828
Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.7341
Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice , diversity and top quality .	-3.2134
He is doing well .	-4.8473

It is the first of five scheduled election events next week , with Trump visiting the Republican states of Tennessee and Mississippi on his tour .	-5.5228
While his candidate ’ s confirmation for the vacant post on the Supreme Court is pending , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , because otherwise it is to be feared that Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when they vote in November .	-6.3498
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally tonight and how to watch them online ?	-2.6084
Trump 's rally in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight , Saturday 29 September 2018 .	-3.6072
You can follow Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online via live stream on YouTube below .	-3.0965
Trump will certainly respond to this week ’ s hearings on allegations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court nominee , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office , which must be given by the Senate , has been postponed for at least a week until the FBI investigation is completed .	-6.3363
But the main goal of these campaigns is to mobilize the Republicans , who are facing a crucial election in November .	-4.5872
According to Reuters , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with next week ’ s five election events to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives .	-4.5715
“ The majority in Congress is on the president ’ s agenda , so shortly before the start of the tumultuous campaign , he visits as many states as possible , ” said Reuters , a Trump campaign spokesman who does not want to be named .	-4.7235
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , this evening ’ s campaign at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-4.4678
On Saturday , Trump will visit West Virgina , the state he won with more than 40 % in 2016 , for the second time this month .	-2.6101
Trump is trying to help the Republican nominee for West Virginia Senate , Patrick Morris , who is lagging behind in the polls .	-7.1588
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , a political scientist at West Virginia University , said that it was not a good sign for Morris that the president had to come to improve his poll ratings .	-4.0761
Ryder Cup 2018 : Team USA is ready to fight to sustain the hope of Sunday ’ s ingles .	-4.6943
After three unilateral matches , the fourth matches on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-3.7572
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-3.2124
So where would they say is the momentum now ?	-2.3085
“ They had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so I think that gives us a bit of momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he retired for the day . ”	-5.6156
Europe is , of course , in favour , with four points in the lead , twelve more still to be played .	-5.7093
However , the Americans , as Spieth says , feel a little wind in their sails and there was much encouragement for them , not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and each have three out of four points .	-5.4674
Spieth was superior from the beginning and set a good example .	-4.0135
These callous cheers became louder when his round went on , he gave a decisive putt to score a draw in the game 4 after he and Thomas returned 2 points after 2 games .	-7.2722
His joy over the putt on the 15th hole , with which they won the game , was such that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-5.3527
" You really have to concentrate hard and just worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-9.5233
This is all that remains for each of these players .	-3.2262
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.7896
At this Ryder Cup in the last two days were undeniably Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.6512
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable couple is playing flawless and doing everything right .	-7.2727
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not reach a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but she also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and on Friday morning the back nine .	-5.4273
This run and the way in which their energy seems to flow from this crowd of spectators makes them a favourite on Sunday , and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player signing a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-6.0415
Probably both at the same time on different holes .	-2.5587
To speak of a European victory now would be too hasty .	-3.0212
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short trial with Sergio Garcia , who won the morning with his partner Alex Noren .	-3.6472
With a bogey and two Doubles at the first nine pits of the Spaniards and the Swede , they entered a hole from which they never came again .	-5.2056
On Sunday there is no one to help you out of your hole .	-3.2012
Because of the interactions between the pairings , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye , it is very fascinating to watch the Fourballs and Foursomes at close range .	-5.3991
Europe , as a team , has played better and has taken a significant lead in the last day , but this Foursome-session has also shown that the US team is in the mood for battle , and some , especially Stateside , have doubted .	-11.2371
Europe ’ s 10-6 Ryder Cup Final Day	-3.0450
Europe will take advantage of a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from Saturday 's 4- and 4- matches with 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-4.9735
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to score four points in the Le Golf National .	-3.3617
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who was in charge of receiving the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated a struggling American team in the Morgentliche Fourballs and won the series with 3-1 .	-7.2699
The US offered more resistance in the fours and won two games , but it could not stomach the deficit .	-3.1955
Jim Furyk 's team needs eight points from Sunday 's 12 singles to keep the trophy .	-3.7888
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup .	-12.0676
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat a sobering Woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau through an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.0194
Woods , who played two games on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has lost 19 of his 29 games in fours and fours and seven in a row .	-5.2308
Justin Rose , rested for the early Fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in a 2 & 1 defeat – place one and three in the world .	-3.8743
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.6582
On Saturday , the three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points .	-6.8274
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in 4-pack , and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in 4-pack after losing the first two holes .	-5.0410
Just twice in the Ryder Cup story , a team returns from a four-point deficit to singles , although Holder Furyk 's side only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-3.8775
After two days of second bestial time , however , a Sunday counter looks like it would go beyond it .	-5.4312
North Korea says that there will be “ no ” unilateral disarmament without trust .	-2.6370
North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that under no circumstances would the country unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.2853
Ri Yong Ho told the world body 's annual General Assembly that North Korea took " significant goodwill measures " last year , such as stopping nuclear and missile tests , dismantling the nuclear test site , and the obligation not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-5.7813
" There is no response from the USA , " he said .	-3.0278
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and under such circumstances , there is no possibility that we will disarm unilaterally first . ”	-4.0271
While Ri revived the familiar North Korean grievances about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his statement seemed significant in that it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-5.3155
Ri pointed to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 , when Kim committed to working toward “ denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , ” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-4.3265
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.4603
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of harsh international sanctions against North Korea .	-3.2057
The US insists on " denuclearization first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling way , and even reject " the declaration of the end of the war , " said Ri .	-5.9617
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us .	-2.8869
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust . ”	-2.4277
Ri mentioned no plans for a second Kim / Trump summit , which the US president emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week .	-3.4698
Instead , the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months , adding : " If the party were to deal with the issue of denuclearization for South Korea and not the US , denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have entered such a dead end . "	-6.0612
Still , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year ’ s report by the U.N. The General Assembly targeting the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump called Kim a “ rocket man ” on a suicide mission .	-5.4540
This year , at the United Nations , Trump , who last year threatened to “ completely destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea annihilated denuclearization .	-4.6668
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no time frame for this , saying , " It doesn 't matter whether it takes two years , three years , or five months . "	-4.5529
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.6379
However , in the United States , Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that ' the enforcement of the Security Council 's sanctions must be continued vigorously and without a shortage until we achieve full , definitive and verified denuclearization ' .	-6.8146
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-6.5085
Pompeo met Ri on the fringes of the UN General Assembly , and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.7684
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-2.5221
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress had been made , and only a few hours after that , North Korea condemned him for “ demands like a gangster . ”	-6.0506
At a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes ' appropriate action ' .	-4.7364
He said Kim told him that the " appropriate measures " he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-4.0772
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough rest .	-3.5039
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep in order to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the koffeine " spent nights " .	-5.2883
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.2709
Charles Czenisler , professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course , which he considers to be the first of its kind in the US .	-5.1056
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deficiency on learning .	-3.4683
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is this only being said to me now , in my final year ?	-4.8793
She said that she never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he told the Telegraph .	-3.6472
The course , which will be offered for the first time this year , explains to the students how good sleep habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-5.7227
Paul Barreira , a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School , and executive director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after noting that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-5.9512
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.9459
In a section there is a picture of a sleeping bag where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers , and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light , and about how the performance of sports can be influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeping routine .	-7.6240
Another section explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-2.2299
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily lives .	-2.8097
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-2.3927
" But we believe that they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health impact of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czenisler .	-5.0420
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students makes sleep deprivation a growing problem .	-4.8787
Having enough sleep of good quality , the " secret weapon " of a student should be to fight stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - also not to be absorbed , as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-5.8971
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czenisler design the course after he visited one of his classes last year at Harvard .	-5.1523
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus course .	-3.6262
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all research groups to undertake a similar program before entering the competition college .	-5.9800
Prof. Czenisler recommended that students alarm when they should go to bed and when they should wake up , and be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " , which is broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can get their circadian rhythm out of the beat , leading to problems of falling asleep .	-9.0266
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal erhält Gerrard Men	-5.3178
The Rangers continued to lose : After a match of Dolly Menga , Livingston lost 1-to-0 for Steven Gerrard .	-10.6021
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4 : 1 victory in February in St. Johnstone , but Gary Holt ’ s team added Gerrard ’ s second defeat to 18 games as a coach , leaving his team eight points behind the disappointing Ladbrokes Premier Hearts .	-6.9140
Menga landed a match seven minutes before the half-time , and an inspirational ranger did not look like she could strike a balance .	-7.3537
While the Rangers now fall back to sixth place , Livingston climbed to rank three and are behind Hibernian only because of the score difference .	-6.0037
New difficulties for the Rangers are emerging , as regular judges Calum Spence had to receive a head wound after being hit by a throwing object – apparently thrown out of the away fan sector .	-8.4570
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed Ayr and hit the semi-finals of the Betfeld Cup .	-5.7909
Holt , on the other hand , set up the same Livi-Elf , which dropped a point at the hearing last week , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team never allowed opponents to take action .	-7.5847
The Rangers dominated the ball , but Livingston improved his chances .	-11.2545
They should have met in just two minutes when Mengas sent his first offshoot Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor ’ s Tor , but the midfield player lost his big change at the gate .	-6.9395
A deep blow from Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far to the rear of the post .	-4.7429
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than penetration into their own game , in the last third .	-3.5543
Alfredo Morelos clearly believed after the end of the first quarter of an hour that he deserved a penalty after he and Steven Lawless clashed , but umpire Steven Thomson did not respond to the appeals of the Colombian .	-12.5063
The Rangers only get two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly off the head jump of Lassana Coulibalys and the hit of a bistless Ovie Ejaria .	-6.5200
Even though Livi ’ s 34th minute opening meeting may have been contrary to the course of the game , no one can deny that she deserved it for her efforts alone .	-8.1805
Again , the Rangers failed to master a Jacobean default situation .	-4.3535
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball , keeping the rest and picking Menga out for a simple finish .	-4.4985
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent , and the change immediately affected the game when the grand player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-4.4197
But Livingston repeatedly drew guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett having long balls .	-6.0311
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood up to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow left the corner .	-5.8779
The Rangers ' representative Glenn Middleton had another late claim to a penalty , as he promised to be with Jacobs , but he once again saw Thomson look away .	-7.4560
Almanach : The Inventor of the Geiger Counter	-1.5886
And now a page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : September 30 , 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger , was born in Germany .	-4.1286
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as Geiger Meter .	-2.9520
Since then , the Geigercounter has also become a mainstream of science , as in the 1950s film " Bells of Coronado " , which was apparently improbable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-6.5403
Man : ' What about everything in the world is this ? '	-2.6516
Rogers : “ It is a Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium .	-2.8634
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals . ”	-3.6695
Evans : “ Tell us , but now it is cracking mightily ! ”	-5.1857
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.5067
But the invention bearing its name is still used .	-2.4075
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-2.0636
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-2.3046
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of the treatment .	-2.0632
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from a patient , changing them in the laboratory .	-3.2678
You can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject again .	-2.7375
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers .	-2.9873
A woman treated with the vaccine that helps the immune system detect rogue cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-3.1408
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , to modify them in the laboratory , so that a protein named HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many cancers , and then to inject the cells again .	-4.5101
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : " Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine . "	-2.7046
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various cancers ” , including breast , ovarian , lung , and intestinal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.7366
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia .	-3.9710
After his performance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed in MAGA cap , had a pro-Trump tirade piled .	-4.9210
It ’ s Not Good	-3.2436
Kanye West was featured in the studio during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after a speech praising the US , President Donald Trump , and said he will be playing in 2020 .	-7.7448
Having performed his third night song , Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great cap , he incited the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-4.3690
" As often as I speak with a white person , she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-2.8872
Well , if I were worried about racism , I would have been out of America a long time ago , " he said .	-6.2954
The Saturday-Night-Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh 's statement to the Senate Justice Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford 's allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually coerced her .	-5.4218
Although it was not aired , the film material was shared by comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-5.3871
It is not clear whether Rock has tried to mock West with his contribution .	-3.8382
West also complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the stage because of his headgear .	-3.4242
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.5948
You said : ' Do not go out with your hat . '	-4.1571
You annoyed me !	-1.9731
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.4982
West continued : " Do you want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would " attract my Superman cloak , because that means you can 't tell me what to do .	-5.5060
Try it with love . ”	-1.4317
His comments were greeted at least twice by the audience , and Saturday Night Live ’ s comedians seemed to be embarrassed , reported Variety , and quoted a person saying , “ The whole studio was dead . ”	-5.2248
West had been used as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , the rapper Mac Miller , died a few days   .	-3.6461
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , dressed in Perrier Bottle .	-3.5209
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TUSA , Candace Turner , who twittered : " This is one of the boldest minds : THANK YOU TO THE MAFIA WIDERSET TEST . "	-5.0222
But Talkmaster Karen Hunter tweeted that West is " what he is , and that 's absolutely wonderful " .	-3.2458
“ But I will not reward anyone ( by buying his music or clothing , or by supporting his art ) , from which I believe he accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-4.6579
It is free .	-0.7755
We also , " added them .	-2.3030
Before the show , the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now called “ the being formally known as Kanye West ” .	-8.4457
He is not the first artist to change her name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy , also known as Puff Daddy , Puffy and P Diddy .	-2.2592
Mitrapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and , of course , that of the later music legend Prince , changed his name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince .	-4.7276
He was charged with attempted murder after knife stabbing in Belfasteners restaurant .	-5.5349
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday .	-5.9778
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore , the police announced .	-2.0515
The accused is expected to appear at the Belfast County Court on Monday .	-2.9174
The charges are reviewed by the public prosecutor .	-3.4848
Game of Thrones -Star Kit Harington Exhausts Toxic Male	-4.3080
Kit Harington is known for his hard-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO 's brachial medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones .	-3.9540
But the actor , 31 , has resented the stereotype of macho and has said that such roles on the canvas lead to small boys often feel that they must be hard to be respected .	-5.3001
Kit said to " The Sunday Times Culture " , he believes that something went wrong and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <unk> MeToo era .	-3.0989
Kit , which had recently married his co-star Rose Leslie , also 31 , admitted that he thought it very important to solve the problem .	-3.1533
I personally feel quite strong at the moment - what have we done wrong with masculinity ? , he said .	-2.8627
What have we taught men in their youth about the problem we are now seeing ?	-3.7472
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters .	-3.7384
He continues : What is innate and what is taught ?	-2.0344
What is taught on television and on the street does the young boy feel that they must have this particular side of being a man ?	-4.5351
I think that is really one of the big issues in our time – how can we change that ?	-4.0685
For something has obviously gone wrong for young men .	-2.7463
In the interview , he also admitted that he would not make a game of throne predecessors or locations when the series ends next summer , adding that he is ready for battlefields and horses .	-6.0642
As of November , Kit will play a new edition of Sam Shepard 's True West , which deals with the history of a film producer and a robber , his brother .	-4.5532

HIV / AIDS : China reports 14 % increase in new cases	-1.6451
China has announced a 14 % increase in its fellow citizens living with HIV and AIDS .	-2.9686
According to the health authorities , 820,000 people are affected in the country .	-2.0181
In the second quarter of 2018 alone , 40,000 new cases were reported .	-1.6194
In the vast majority of new cases , the virus was transmitted through sexual intercourse , which is a change from the past .	-3.8696
HIV usually spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions .	-3.2576
But the number of people affected by HIV was reduced to almost zero , Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province .	-3.5018
However , compared with the previous year , the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 .	-3.2448
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community .	-1.6143
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997 , but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread .	-1.7911
Studies estimate that 70 – 90 % of men who have sex with men end up marrying women because of the country ’ s conservative values .	-2.6047
These diseases are often transmitted by unprotected sex .	-1.5873
In 2003 , China ’ s government promised universal access to HIV drugs in an attempt to contain the problem .	-2.3423
Maxine Waters denies that an employee read the data of GOP senators , criticizes the allegations as “ dangerous lies ” and “ conspiracy theories . ”	-3.2094
On Saturday , the US MP Maxine Waters rejected allegations that one of their staff was alleged to have published personal data from three Republican US senators on legislators ’ Wikipedia pages .	-6.4274
The Los Angeles based democrat believes that the claims of ultra-left wing members and Web sites have been launched .	-5.2740
" Lies , lies , and even more repugnant lies , " said Waters in a Twitter statement .	-4.0367
According to the published information , US Senator Lindsey Graham ’ s private addresses and telephone numbers from South Carolina , as well as US Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both from Utah .	-4.1764
The information appeared Thursday online , posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.4936
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the Kavanaugh survey .	-3.6175
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters ' office and that a member of staff had published information from Waters , Hill reported .	-5.5527
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continued .	-3.7441
“ The employee of my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the fact that this information was read .	-4.3124
This unsubstantiated claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-4.3037
Waters ’ statement quickly led to online criticism , including by former White House Secretary Ari Fleischer .	-4.4551
“ It is extremely annoying that the matter is denied , ” Fleischer wrote .	-3.8056
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a congress member .	-3.0400
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-3.0632
They must not be complacent .	-3.3618
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-2.2032
They have to be calm and quiet ” .	-3.9102
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters ’ response to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , who was accused by critics of appearing too angry at the Thursday hearing .	-3.7074
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate running alongside the sedless Waters in the midterm elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.4882
" Big , if true " , he has reached .	-5.2775
In her statement , Waters said that her office ' informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims .	-3.8839
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are caught and held to account for their actions , which are destructive and dangerous to my employees , ” she continued .	-4.4281
Review of " Johnny English – You live only three times " – poorly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.7413
It is a tradition in every new film with a British tendency to look for a hint of Brexit , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy spoof franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-7.9566
Is the ironic self-satire about humanity on the brink the nation ’ s new export capacity ?	-6.7924
In any case , Johnny English has been licensed for the second time to reprogramme things .	-8.2297
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims on Smoothie-Glamour , got a little clouseau , a syringe Mr. Bean and a kick from this guy and who contributed a single note to the leitmelodie of the firefighters at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-7.4509
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television show , always leaving chaos behind .	-5.5209
There are one or two great moments in this latest Johnny England comedy .	-3.4598
I loved Johnny English , who is approaching a helicopter in a medieval armour and briefly beating the main gate against his helmet .	-4.5162
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy can be seen , but humor feels rather weak and strangely unnecessary , especially as the " serious " film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible deliberately offer as an ingredient .	-5.9036
The humor feels as though it is directed at children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson 's Mr. Bean movies .	-5.5663
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great trouble .	-3.4300
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain ’ s highly secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to the horror of the service agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-4.7730
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a poignant and contested personality and is already experiencing a complete meltdown of political unpopularity .	-4.8942
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as every single active spy has been compromised , she has to get someone out of retirement .	-4.9081
And that means the rabble-rousing Johnny English himself , who is now a schoolmaster in a noble institution , but gives unparalleled lessons on how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy over espionage .	-6.2471
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency combat and is reunited with his former , long suffering mate Bough , who is once again played by Ben Miller .	-5.9149
Bough is now a married man who meets a U-boat commander , a haughty , burschism role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully respected .	-7.7648
So , the Batman and Robin of Chaos in the Secret Service of Her Majesty are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-2.9457
Meanwhile , the prime minister is being dangerously captured by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the sinister Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.7196
English and Bough begin their odyssey of the colourful Highjinks : dressed as waiters , they ignite a French flash-restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on board Voltas luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a virtual reality headset inside Voltas House .	-5.7368
For this last sequence , I am sure all the registers have been drawn , but as amiable and omitted as it is , it reminds me of children 's television .	-7.8102
Quite moderately .	-1.8484
As with the other Johnny England films , I could not help thinking : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-5.7722
Labour denies having developed a plan for British people for a four-day week , for which five days are paid .	-4.1519
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan in which British work only four days a week but are paid for five .	-4.0556
According to reports , the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution to workers by giving them an extra day .	-4.4339
Staff would enjoy a three day weekend - but still bring the same money home .	-4.4085
Sources have said that the idea would " fit " with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country to the benefit of workers .	-5.0884
The trade union congress approved the changeover to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-4.1952
A high-level Labour source said to the Sunday Times : a review of policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-4.0890
A four-day week is an objective consistent with the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance to workers and the party ’ s overall industrial strategy , but that goal will not be realised overnight .	-4.9142
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 campaign .	-3.0743
However , this is not currently supported by the whole Labour Party .	-3.5692
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-5.5188
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-3.2391
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profiteers ' in utilities .	-5.5986
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current owners of water companies may not get their full share back , as a Labour government could " take off " because of alleged misbehavior .	-6.7053
He also confirmed the plans to appoint employees in company management and to create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of private sector companies ’ equity to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-5.3976
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 Minutes ” about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds .	-2.5309
Following an ongoing FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote to appeal to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week , and the question of whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could induce Republican senators to give up their support for Kavanaugh .	-6.1492
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , correspondent for “ 60 Minutes , ” interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could persuade them to change their minds .	-4.4934
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina .	-2.1041
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.3851
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.9729
I called him after that happened after that statement came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-4.5623
He was determined , purposeful , unequivocal . '	-2.4135
Graham 's voice , however , seemed to be carved in stone .	-3.2754
" I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb draft , " he said .	-2.7946
“ Dr Ford , I do not know what happened , but I know that Brett vehemently denied the charge , ” Graham added to Christine Blasey Ford .	-4.0901
" No one she called could confirm it .	-2.8070
It was 36 years ago .	-1.4880
I see nothing new that is changing . '	-2.0441
" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty ? "	-2.2553
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.7372
At this year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival , tens of thousands of people will gather at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the real goal of the event : ending extreme poverty by 2030 .	-8.4855
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Projects , an international interest group aiming to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-3.8117
In order to get a free ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole range of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteer work , an email to a world leader , a telephone call or any other useful way of raising awareness and raising the goal of poverty reduction .	-6.9113
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.8163
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of the so-called " Clicktivism " - people who feel that sending a tweet by signing an online petition or an online application or thereby sending a tweet as if they would make a real difference ?	-6.5384
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters , who have pushed for a variety of different goals .	-9.8842
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-3.4231
In early 2018 , the Group launched 390 operations and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid out or financed .	-4.0875
The group estimates that funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world .	-3.2263
Among the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children develop their full potential . ” The organization has pledged to support Rwanda with $ 35 million to end the country ’ s undernourishment after Global Citizens have made more than 4,700 tweets .	-6.3226
“ With the support of the British government , donors , other state governments , and global citizens like you , we can make the social injustice of malnutrition history one day , ” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.2320
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition , the government will finance the Power of Nutrition project 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions .	-4.5720
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on her website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.8541
Global citizen responded : it will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-3.8288
Like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-3.3577
Among others , the stars Janet Jackson , Weedknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year ’ s New York event hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-4.9892
US could use the Navy to build a “ blockade ” to impede Russian energy exports – Interior ministers   .      e e  e  e e e .	-9.3089
Washington can use its navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , when US Secretary of the Interior , Ryan Zinke , is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-4.7452
Zinke claimed that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria – especially in activities that were invited by the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-6.5343
“ I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is as follows : they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.8990
And , according to the officials , there are ways and means to deal with it .	-3.8532
" The United States has this ability to work with our navy to ensure that the sea routes are open and , if necessary , to block in order to ensure that its energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-4.9262
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.4155
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran , and found that they are indeed the same .	-3.2509
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is , more or less , to use and replace fuels , " he said , while calling Russia a " one-Trick-ony " with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy .	-5.5186
Opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission of boosting exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replacing Russia , the much more favorable option for European consumers .	-4.9515
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are thus trying to get Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ Moscow ’ s capture . ”	-4.9966
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 , which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-2.9973
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-3.0555
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said the Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak , following a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.9540
The US stance has provoked a backlash from Germany , which has confirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.2428
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.9261
" I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply , " said the German Industry Confederation ( BDI ) , Dieter Kempf , after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-3.5207

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for the presidency after the mid-term elections .	-2.3062
During a council meeting in Holyoke , Massachusetts , Warren confirmed that she would consider running .	-1.8912
" It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government , and that includes a woman at the top , " she said , according to The Hill .	-6.6253
After 6 November , I will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy .	-2.4931
Warren loaded President Donald Trump during the Rauthaussee meeting , saying that he " is leading that country in the wrong direction . "	-5.0336
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.9510
Warren ’ s criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court has not minced on candidate Brett Kavanaugh .	-4.6723
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-3.0010
However , a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe it should run in 2020 .	-3.0190
According to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 % of the " likely " Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not stand .	-3.3921
Thirty-two percent supported such a race .	-1.7267
The survey showed more support for a run by former Governor Devil Patrick , with 38 % for a potential run and 48 % against .	-4.9995

Sarah Palin quotes Palin ’ s PTSD in Donald Trump ’ s Campaign	-2.8254
Track Palin , 26 , spent a year in Iraq after he was called in September .	-1.6055
He was arrested and charged for an incident involving domestic violence on Monday evening .	-2.9447
“ Against the background of what my own son is doing , what he is going through just after he has returned , I can understand other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are experiencing , ” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa , Oklahoma .	-5.7390
Palin called his arrest “ the elephant in the room , ” and said about her son and other veterans : “ They come back a little differently , coming back harder , coming back and wondering whether the work of their co-soldiers and the air force and all the other members of the military for the country is respected . ”	-5.9292

18 States D. C support the challenge of a new asylum policy	-3.4047
18 states and Washington , DC , support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-2.7445
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the Washington District filed an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) on Friday to assist an asylum seeker in challenging the law .	-4.3657
The complete name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace against Sessions , filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Law is not known .	-8.2173
She said that her partner " and his violent sons of gang members " had abused them , but on July 20 , US officials refused to apply for asylum .	-2.8300
She was arrested in Texas .	-0.8256
The lawyers of the states that support Grace called El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which include a large number of asylum seekers in the US , nations facing deep problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-4.5721
The new US asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Board that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can seek asylum .	-3.3635
The District Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new law ignores decades of state , federal , and international law .	-3.6912
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all applications for asylum must be assessed according to the circumstances of the respective lawsuit and such action violates this principle .	-5.4561
Lawyers continued to argue that the policies that refuse immigrants entry hurt the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and " do necessary work . "	-4.4575
Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration magistrates in June not to grant asylum to people fleeing domestic or bandage .	-4.9097
“ Asylum is for those who have to leave their homeland because of persecution on the basis of race , religion , nationality or affiliation to a particular social group or because of political opinion , ” Sessions said in his declaration of the law on 11 June .	-6.4507
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems , even the serious ones that people face every day around the world .	-4.1317

US ambassador accuses China of “ bullying ” with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.2806
A week after an official Chinese newspaper issued a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper about the mutual benefits of US-China trade , the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda .	-8.5446
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid side of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register , the state with Iowa ’ s top-selling newspaper , after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 US congressional elections , which China denies .	-5.0132
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.7524
While it is normal for foreign states to advertise to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-4.0675
At an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs on Chinese and US professionals were supposed to meet exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-8.6243
Terry Branstad , US ambassador to China and former Iowa Governor for many years , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing violated American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-6.4197
China , Branstad wrote in an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ is now vigorously pursuing this harassment through propaganda in our own free press .	-5.4981
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government takes advantage of the valued American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom , ” Branstad wrote .	-4.0459
" By contrast , you will find only limited dissenting voices at the newspaper stand in Beijing ’ s streets , and you will not see any real opposition to differences of opinion that the Chinese people might have about China ’ s worrying economic development , bearing in mind that the media are firmly in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-6.7273
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers disagreed with the publication offer , " although he did not say which newspaper .	-3.1786
Republicans blush with the Kavanugh debacle voters against the Midterm-elections , analysts warn .	-4.6346
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee to the Supreme Court , despite being accused of sexual assault , and analysts warn that they will see a backlash in the upcoming elections , especially by women .	-5.2165
Emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-3.0096
These things cannot be traced , Grant Reeher , Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University ’ s Maxwell School , said on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-3.4004
Reeher said he doubted that last-minute support for FBI investigations by Jeff Flake ( Republican MP for Arizona ) is sufficient to reconcile angry female voters .	-4.6255
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor will they forget it in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on on on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-4.3551
On Friday morning , the protesters sang : “ November is coming ! ” while demonstrating in the Senate hall , when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford ’ s statement , Mic reported .	-5.0807
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalist .	-1.5739
" People say that it is already quite advanced , that is true .	-3.8200
But the figure could be higher , especially among those in the suburbs and younger voters , 18- to 29-year-olds who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-12.6085
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she made her allegations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court ’ s nominee , analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans drove the candidacy .	-6.4661
“ For the GOP , this has become a chaotic mess , ” said Michael Steele , former Republican National Committee Chairman , earlier last week , according to NBC News .	-4.1751
“ It is not just a matter of committee voting or final voting , or whether Kavanaugh is put on the replacement bank , but rather of how the Republicans have handled it and how they treated it , ” said Guy Cecil , Director of US priorities , a group that helps to elect the Democrats , the news . the or or . e or . or or or or or or or or . or or or	-15.9678
However , the Americans are divided on the statements made by Ford and Kavanaugh .	-3.2454
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 % of respondents believed Ford ’ s testimony definitively or probably , while 35 % said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh .	-3.6667
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying while he said , while only 30 % said the same about Ford .	-3.9945
On the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.9416
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked them drunk at the age of 17 .	-3.3397
Ramirez accused the highest judge of having exposed his genitals to her during her studies at Yale in the 1980s at a party .	-5.3630
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook .	-2.1733
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , is a start-up company to compete with Facebook , Amazon , and Google .	-2.9882
The current technology legend project , interrupt , is a company that builds on the open source platform “ Solid ” by Berners-Lee .	-3.6215
With Solid users can define where their data is stored and which people can have access to what information .	-4.0909
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee joked that the goal of interrupt was to take over world domination .	-3.6178
“ We must do it now , ” he said about startup .	-2.6440
“ It is a historic moment . ”	-1.5344
The app uses Solid technology , which enables users to create their own personal online data storage or a POD .	-7.9265
Data storage can contain contact lists , task lists , calendars , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-2.8958
It is like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Slack and Spotify all available on a browser and all at the same time .	-1.7241
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user what access is possible to what kind of information .	-5.2414
The company calls it “ enabling people through data . ”	-3.3437
According to the CEO of John Bruce , apprupt will provide resources , processes and related know-how to make Solid accessible to a broad audience .	-4.7209
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform acquired by IBM , some employees involved in the project , and a community of volunteer programmers .	-3.8433
As of this week , technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the interrupt website .	-3.2585
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor himself will talk to Facebook and Google about the major changes that will upend all previous business models overnight .	-3.6988
“ We will not ask for permission ” .	-1.8736
In a Saturday article on Medium , Berners-Lee wrote that Inrits ' mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid Web . '	-3.5794

One of his grandchildren , Michael Vann , said that it was “ incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather ’ s heroism .	-3.2278
According to the London Gazette , Lieutenant Vann led his battalion in September 1918 through the Saint-Quentin Canal “ in very dense fog and under heavy fire by field guns and machine guns ” .	-8.3715
Later , he stormed to the firing line and led the line forward with the “ biggest Galanterie ” , before moving a field gun one hand and pressing the withdrawal three times .	-7.5935
Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4 , 1918 – just under a month before the end of the war .	-4.8600
Michael Vann , 72 , said his grandfather 's actions were ' something I know I could never do justice to , something that instills humility ' .	-3.7426
He and his brother , James Vann , also laid down a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band .	-3.7992
Michael Vann said he felt “ very honored to participate in the parade , ” adding : “ The bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people . ”	-4.0185
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206 , instead they got Peppa Pig .	-2.8660
Imagine that you stayed awake all night to watch the full Bellator 206-Event , just to not see the main event .	-5.8395
On the plan in San Jose there were 13 fights , including six main fights and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK .	-4.6185
At 6 o 'clock in the morning , when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other , British viewers were stunned to see how the coverage was switched to Peppa Pig .	-5.7345
Some were unimpressed after they woke up until the early hours of the morning , especially for the fight .	-7.1435
A fan on Twitter described the change to the children 's cardboard as " some sick joke " .	-4.0560
" It is a state regulation that at 6 o 'clock in the morning these contents were not suitable so that they had to switch to children 's programs , " said Dave Schwartz , Bellar Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication , when asked for the transfer .	-5.5311
'Peppa the pig , ' yes ' .	-1.4807
Bellator ’ s CEO Scott Coker said that they will be working on their planning in the future to involve British viewers .	-5.9971
" When I think about the repetition , we will somehow get it , " said Cocker .	-3.4739
“ But it ’ s 6 in the morning on a Sunday there and we ’ ll be able to fix it only on the Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-5.8615
But we are working on this .	-1.7610
Believe me when it was turned off , very much was written and the contents were all not friendly .	-3.5583
We tried to fix it , we thought it would be a technical error .	-1.9292
But it was not , it was a government problem .	-2.2063
I can promise you that it will not happen next time .	-2.3357
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we have tried to outperform the fans and have simply gone over .	-4.4920
It is an unfavourable situation . '	-1.8786
Desert Island discs : Tom Daley felt himself inferior because of his sexuality .	-2.5129
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed .	-4.2226
The 24-year-old said that he was only at secondary school aware that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.8775
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said that he spoke publicly about gay rights in order to give others “ hope . ”	-3.5212
He also said that a victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important for him .	-2.8312
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has been released for several months due to a disease .	-4.2602
Daley appeared in Lavernes ’ first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” than others as a adolescent , because “ society did not accept standing on men and women . ”	-4.7708
He said , “ So far , these feelings of Weniger Wert-One and of otherness have given me the strength and strength that I needed to succeed . ”	-5.1331
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , in order not to disappoint anyone if he was aware of his sexual orientation .	-4.2088
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT activist and took advantage of his presence at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-4.1781
He said he had spoken because he was fortunate enough to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give hope to others .	-4.4816
The triple world champion said that he fell in love with a man , the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , which he was very surprised about .	-3.7535
Daley married the Oscar winner , 20 years older than him , last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-3.6828
“ If so much is done in such a young age , ” he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14 , three years later his father died of cancer , if he had found it difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar highs and lows .	-6.7283
The couple was parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June , and Daley said his " whole perspective " has changed .	-2.1671
“ Last year I was all about winning a gold medal , ” he said .	-3.1856
" But you know what is more important than Olympic gold .	-2.5189
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.7686
His son is named after his father , Robert , who died in 2011 with only 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-3.9548
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-2.7511
" I could not tell him : <unk> You will not experience sitting in the first row , Dad <unk> , " he said .	-3.6845
“ I held his hand when his breathing was suspended , and only when he really was no longer breathing and dead , I realized that he was not invincible , ” he said .	-5.4293
The following year Daley joined the 2012 Olympics and won bronze .	-2.6479
“ I had dreamed of this all my life – diving into the water in front of local audiences at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling , ” he said .	-4.4322
This was also inspired by his first choice of songs – Proud by Heather Small .	-8.8869

The Weak Mickelson sat on the Ryder Cup Saturday at the Bank .	-2.4704
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he must dramatically improve his shape so that it won 't be a sad milestone .	-5.3126
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.6775
Instead of being at the center of the event , as is so often the case for the United States , the five-fold champion shared his day between shots and practice rounds at the golf course in the hope of overcoming his low .	-7.7325
The 48-year-old is never the straightest driver even at the height of his career and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National course , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-5.9268
And as if the course alone were not challenging enough , Mickelson will meet in the ninth match on Sunday at the British-Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood .	-6.6547
If Americans lag four points in the start of the 12 individual games and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-4.3903
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband ; what was left to him , too .	-4.3323
" He has fully understood the role he had today , gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.4094
" He has a lot of self-confidence .	-1.7920
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-2.5092
I would probably not have thought he was playing two games .	-3.0935
I had hoped for more , but that is how it came about and that is the way we thought we had to tackle it .	-6.2174
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.8140
So far , Nick Faldo holds the record for most of the matches played at the Ryder Cup , which Mic will  .  . e e e e e    e e e e e e e . e	-11.4450
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully aligned with the heights of his individual record .	-4.3084
He had won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times in a tie .	-5.8398
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he said .	-10.5317
I think the younger players were also happy this week to compete with him , which was nice to see . ”	-6.1263
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.6440
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead can soon disappear .	-3.7225
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a big lead in the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup can quickly become an uncomfortable ride .	-4.4184
In 1997 , the Dane made his debut in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans , but only barely crossed the finish line and won 13 <unk> with a razor-thin margin of 14 <unk> .	-6.8048
" We remember that we were in the lead in Valderrama ; we had a big lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but only narrowly , " Bjorn said , after winning the Class of 2018 , now leading with 10-6 in Le Golf National , Friday , and yesterday with a 5-3 victory .	-7.0469
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.6401
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-1.9181
Go out and do the right things .	-1.6675
It is only past when the points on the board are displayed .	-4.8691
Our aim is to win this Cup , and that is what we are focusing on .	-5.4890
I have always said that I strongly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.7065
Enthusiastic as his players have played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be too quick .	-5.0172
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.3544
Tomorrow the personal performances are coming , and that is another matter .	-3.8987
It is great to be out there with a partner when things are going well , but if you are out there alone , your abilities as a golf player are tested on the whole .	-6.1529
This is the message that players need to get the best out of tomorrow .	-3.6342
Now you pass on to your partner and he must make full use of it , just like you . ”	-4.9709
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive to make his players perform better than they do as partners , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have scored three out of four points .	-5.3782
Furyk himself has already experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , when he was part of the winning team in Brookline , and now he is one of the losers after the European team achieved the “ miracle of Medinah . ”	-5.8387
" I remember every damn word , " he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the 1999 captain , had gathered his players on the way in the last day .	-3.7487
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to get started as soon as possible , as you saw in Brookline , in Medinah .	-4.4998
Once a momentum has developed , the big pressure on the middle matches will be exerted .	-6.9042
We have built our line-up accordingly , and brought the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-5.8836
Thomas , along with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , the other European in the top ranking , should lead the counterstrike against Rory McIlroy in the lead game .	-5.1643
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " Bjorn said about his individual selection .	-3.3404
Renewal of the timetable for Germany ’ s new warship	-3.2792
The German Navy ’ s latest frigate should have been in service as early as 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships , which , according to reports of flawed systems and escalating costs , will now take at least until next year .	-6.3113
The commissioning of the " Rheinland-Pfalz " , the flagship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper " Die Zeit " , referring to a military spokesman .	-5.0671
The Navy should have started operations in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery weighed down the ambitious project .	-4.5499
The four frigates of the Baden-Württenberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-3.9217
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles , and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.4926
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frigates are to be used for up to two years without connecting the home port .	-5.5783
However , the state of the art warships that Germany is supposed to be able to project power overseas will be out of date by the constant delays when they are finally put into service , as the weekly newspaper “ Die Zeit ” notes .	-7.5149
The ill-fated F125-frigate made headlines last year , when the German Navy officially refused to start the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg .	-4.5705
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery .	-3.3079
Little was known about the reasons for the return of the ships ; German media mentioned a number of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would render the war ship useless in combat missions .	-5.5052
Defects in the software were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are served by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older frigates of the Bremen class .	-5.9346
It also transpired that the ship is overweight , which would limit its performance and make future upgrades difficult for the Navy .	-5.4829
It is believed that the 7,000-ton “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as heavy as the same class ships used by Germans during World War II .	-4.9688
In addition to faulty hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - will also be discussed  .	-7.2021
Instead of the initially projected € 2.2 billion , the cost now seems to have reached the staggering amount of € 3.1 billion ( roughly $ 3.6 billion ) .	-4.1285
The problems of the latest frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s sea power is dwindling .	-4.7721
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defence Committee , admitted that the war fleet actually “ runs out of operational ships . ”	-4.7753
The official said that over time the problem has grown in a avalanche-like manner , as old ships were decommissioned without any replacement .	-7.8040
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates were put into service by the Navy .	-3.8478
The National Trust is covering the secret lives of bats .	-3.0352
New research on a site in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to find out how bats use the landscape to search for food .	-5.0409
It is hoped that this will provide new insights into the behaviour of the unique flying mammals that can guide future measures to protect animals .	-5.1860
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by common and soprano pistols , brown long-tailed and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross .	-5.7146
Special recording equipment will be placed at the main points of the accommodation to follow bats activities throughout the season .	-5.5686
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with handheld monitors .	-3.1705
An expert sound analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of bats and assigns calls to species .	-4.5418
The habitat map to be created and the corresponding report should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-4.8099
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species .	-3.6857
This information will help to identify the benefits of living space management , how to best preserve meadows and forests for bats and other related species .	-4.8423
There has been a sharp decline in the UK and Scotland over the past hundred years .	-4.5039
They are threatened by construction works that affect their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-3.7768
Wind power plants and lighting can also pose a risk , as well as fly-fishing strips and some chemical treatments of building materials .	-6.1526
Fledermice are not actually blind .	-2.2927
Depending on their nocturnal hunting activities , the ears are more useful than the eyes .	-4.6118
They use sophisticated echo tracking technology to locate errors and obstacles in their route .	-4.9356
The NTS , which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes bats very seriously .	-3.6083
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys , inspect sleep places and sometimes perform rescues .	-4.2250
The organization has even established Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated bat suite in the Threade Estate in Dumfrias and Galloway , home to eight of Scotland ’ s ten bat species .	-4.9532
According to David Thompson , the estate is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.6437
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.7379
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and the whole good habitat .	-2.6149
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other land helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.7518
He stresses that it is important to check whether bats are there before maintenance work in buildings , according to which he is able to kill up to 400 females and young people in the event of accidental destruction of a single sleeping place – a whole local population may be wiped out .	-8.7351
Fledermice are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-3.7154
Elisabeth Ferrell , a Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-2.3916
She said , “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.4395
Ronaldo rejects rape claims when lawyers sue the German magazine .	-3.4059
Cristiano Ronaldo branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claimed that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-3.2846
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the allegations .	-3.5568
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of rape of an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-3.6655
He is said to have paid her $ 375,000 to keep silent about the incident , The Mirror reported on Friday .	-3.0554
Hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers dismissed the reports as “ fake news . ”	-3.5498
No , no , no , no .	-0.6739
What they say today , fake news , ” said the five-time balloon D 'Or-winner in the camera .	-2.4334
“ You want to apply yourself by using my name .	-2.3527
“ That is normal .	-1.7352
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.7760
I am a happy person , and everything is good , ” the player added smiling .	-2.8247
Ronaldos lawyers have filed a lawsuit against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” for claims ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ illegal reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy . ”	-6.9038
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for " immaterial damage equal to the severity of the injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years " .	-4.4503
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.5920
According to documents submitted to the Clark County Court in the state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player ’ s room after getting to know them in a nightclub , where they raped them in the ass .	-6.3686
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” who was let down by the “ 1 % ” .	-4.7323
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-1.4477
Mayorga also claims she had gone to the police and had photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was " afraid of retribution " and worried about being " publicly humiliated " .	-5.3183
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid , as it remains traumatized by the alleged incident .	-4.0154
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Manchester United ’ s Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and moved to Italy ’ s giant Juve this summer with a $ 100 million deal .	-6.6143
Brexit : The UK would regret losing automakers forever .	-3.5113
“ The UK would regret losing its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economics Minister Greg Clark .	-3.9712
He added that it was " worrying " that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their Burnaston plant near Derby if the UK left the EU without a deal .	-4.2469
" We need an agreement , " Clark said .	-1.6008
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of cross-border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-4.1452
The Burnaston plant , which manufactures the Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.0739
“ If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that it will stop production at our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-5.0591
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-3.4621
For example , BMW has already announced that it will close its factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit .	-3.0741
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.7241
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on demand-driven manufacturing , which means that parts are delivered every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for special production .	-7.0375
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border which , according to industry data , may lead to supply shortages and partial shortages .	-4.6327
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stock in its Derbyshire plant , said the company , and so production would be stopped .	-3.6133
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “ precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls . ”	-3.2122
We need to have a deal , we want the best deal that not only allows us to achieve the current success , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme Today .	-5.9534
“ The message not only from Toyota , but also from other manufacturers , is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.3858
Toyota did not indicate how long the production freeze could last , but warned that the increase in costs could cause the long-term competitiveness of the plant and eventually job losses .	-7.8941
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representative , and has been working in Burnaston for 24 years , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ In my experience , once they have been dismantled , jobs are lost forever . ”	-4.6109
One government spokesman said : ' We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-3.1536
Trump ’ s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again , says the White House .	-2.8409
Donald Trump ’ s high-profile meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “ postponed another week , ” as the battle for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-4.2340
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russian electoral interventions , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible obstruction of justice by the president .	-7.7419
Whether Trump will or will not fire the Deputy Attorney General , thereby jeopardizing Müller ’ s independence , has given Washington plenty of gossip for months .	-4.9997
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th Amendment .	-2.9256
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.7937
But last Monday he went to the White House , while there were reports that he was about to resign .	-3.6983
Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was then at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .	-10.5774
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the session was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Justice Committee hearing , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , accused him of sexual misconduct , had left .	-5.0361
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh and continued to delay a full Senate vote .	-3.2971
Donald Trump ’ s press secretary , Sarah Sanders , was on Fox News on Sunday .	-2.0815
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' A date has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I am going back another week , given all the other things that are going to happen with the Supreme Court .	-6.4021
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-2.8176
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10 .	-2.3409
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.2919
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to television reporters who behave like self-actors , but she also said : ' I will not be against them standing in the gallery ' .	-5.5335
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.9550
" The President carries out more questions and answers than any president before him , " she said and added , without any evidence : " We have looked at these figures . "	-5.3170
Briefing will still take place , Sanders said , but if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States the questions directly , that is infinitely better than talking to him .	-4.5868
We are trying to do a lot of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press conversation if you can talk to the President of the United States yourself . ”	-4.5918
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.2277
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.0711
In New York this week , perhaps , the president showed why , by making a frank and sometimes bizarre appearance to assembled reporters .	-5.1910
Brexit Fears : The Health Minister ’ s Letter to EU Workers in the NHS Scotland	-3.2636
The Health Minister has written EU officials in Scotland ’ s NHS to the country ’ s gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit .	-4.1088
The Scottish Parliament MEP Jane Freeman wrote her letter less than six months before Britain left the EU .	-3.3141
The Scottish Government has agreed to accept the cost of the agreed status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public service .	-3.0760
In her letter , Mrs Freeman wrote : ‘ During the summer , negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued , in proportion to expected decisions in the autumn .	-4.7048
But the British government has also intensified preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-2.7036
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you .	-1.9517
That is why I now wanted to repeat how much I would appreciate the contribution of every employee , regardless of his nationality .	-5.0684
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve our health care and benefit the patients and communities we provide .	-4.5059
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay . ”	-2.7790

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp rate when buying property in the UK - the extra money will be used for the homeless , Theresa May announced today .	-4.6128
This move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn ’ s drive to attract young voters with promises , offer more affordable housing , and seek high incomes .	-4.1126
The stamp fee is levied on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK , and the additional money will help the government fight homelessness .	-5.2080
The premium - which is charged in addition to the current stamp tax , including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and rental - could be up to three percent .	-6.1854

The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp cut to help more young people have their first house .	-3.6641
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying land cheaply but not building it , and he called on Mrs May to abolish affordable housing quotas to end the housing misery in Britain .	-5.8610
Mr Corbyn has announced a concise series of proposed housing reforms , including rental controls and the termination of non-debt evictions .	-4.7187
He also wants to give the councils more powers to build new houses .	-2.3891
Mrs May said : ‘ Last year , I said that I dedicate my premiere to the revival of the British dream – life should be better for every new generation .	-4.0858
And that means putting our broken housing market in order .	-3.0269
Britain will always be open to people who live , work , and want to build a life .	-2.8105
However , it cannot be right for foreign companies and people who do not live in the UK to buy homes just as easily as for hard-working British citizens .	-4.3265

Jack Ross : “ My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland . ”	-1.0332
Jack Ross , currently Sunderland manager , says that his “ ultimate goal ” is to become a Scottish manager at some point .	-6.4710
The club is currently ranked third in League One and is three points behind the top .	-6.6146
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after he led St Mirren back to Scotland 's first league last season .	-5.0560
“ I wanted to play as a player for my country . ”	-2.3439
I got a B cap and that 's it , " Ross said to BBC Scotland 's Sportsound .	-3.3854
" But I have often observed Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child , and it is always something that has brought me back .	-2.6452
" This chance would only come if I were successful in club management . "	-4.5209
Before Ross were Dick Advocaat , David Moyes , Sam Allardyce , Martin O 'Neill , Roy Keane , Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio Manager of Sunderland .	-2.3682
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of these established managers in such a large club .	-5.3374
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this club back to the Premier League ? "	-3.8687
With its structure and facilities , this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League , ” he said .	-2.6491
" Creating it is not an easy task , but I would probably only consider myself successful if I can bring the club back there . "	-4.7477
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as a co-coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-3.9923
He then helped Allaa to recover from the relegation to the third class , and made St. Mirren the champion of the next season .	-6.1609
Ross also says that he never felt as comfortable as he is now during his playing career with Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academic .	-5.4893
" It was probably a real crossroads , " he remembered when he took the lead of Alloa .	-3.4378
“ I really thought that the position as a manager is the right one for me , even more than that of a player .	-4.5453

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for the battered British pubs , but has increased pressure on restaurant chains .	-3.8149
Pub- and bar groups experienced a sales increase of 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant revenues decreased 4.8 percent , according to the figures .	-5.4700
Peter Martin , of the CGA management consultancy , who compiled the figures , said : " Sustained sunshine and England 's prolonged participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as last month of June , when pub visits increased by 2.8 % only that the restaurants were more affected .	-7.1637
The 1.8 % decline in the catering sector in June only worsened in July .	-3.7264
Pubs and bars dominated by drinks were by far the strongest , with Like-for-Like numbers rising more than restaurants fell .	-5.2133
Food dominated pubs were also under the sun , though not as dramatic as restaurant operators .	-4.4449
It seems that people only wanted to go out for a drink .	-2.3587
In the pubs and bars under management , sales for drinks increased by 6.6 % this month , while food fell by 3 % . '	-4.1046
Paul Newman , an RSM analyst for leisure and hospitality , said : " These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April .	-2.7937
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market .	-4.3307
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still under pressure , although a 4.8 % decline in sales over the previous year will be particularly painful , along with continuing cost pressure .	-6.0388
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators , and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we saw in August will provide the much-needed break .	-4.6545

Milk pump advertising comparing mothers with cows led to controversial online discussions .	-2.7080
A dairy pump company has provoked controversial online discussions due to an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with milking cows .	-4.9502
On the occasion of the launch of the supposedly " world 's first silent and portable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show which freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.7454
Four real mothers dance in a hayloft in the middle of cows to a number with the following lyrics : " Yes , I melt , but you don 't see a cock " and " If you haven 't noticed that it 's not a Euter , it 's my breasts " .	-6.8955
The slogan goes on : ' pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I beat my ladies ' .	-4.6942
However , the ad published on the company 's Facebook page has caused controversy online .	-3.2941
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers , many of whom say that it highlights the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-7.1456
'It is a very bad decision to advertise this product with cows ' .	-3.0715
Like us , they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk , except that their babies will be taken away from them within just a few days after birth , " wrote a person .	-8.2086
The Elvie milk pump inconspicuously fits into a Still-Bra ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-5.7924
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.7599
But yes , why not use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-3.3024
Someone else added : ' Such an outsider ' .	-4.2659
Others defended the advertisement , including a woman who confessed that she found the song “ hilarious ” .	-4.9003
I think that is a great idea .	-1.3802
I would have got one if I had my own quilt .	-5.1807
Through the pump I felt like a cow .	-3.1803
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.3233
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-2.2476
Another commented : ' This is a funny advertisement for mothers who pump off ( often in their workplaces or toilets ) and feel like ' cows ' .	-4.2097
This is not an advertisement praising or assessing the dairy industry ' .	-3.3382
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they all danced with the decent pumps in their bras .	-4.4311
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump off milk say they feel like cows .	-3.0912
However , the Elvie Pump is completely silent , has no wires or tubing , and fits inconspicuously into a still bra , giving women the freedom to move , hold their babies and even go out with pumps .	-6.8219
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elvie-pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative market launch .	-4.6868
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.7321

Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a camp on the Texas border .	-6.3446
The number of detained migrant children rose , though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s tough rhetoric and policies made it harder to find sponsors for children .	-4.3255
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and fear that they risk being expelled when they advocate a child .	-3.9696
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to take fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-4.2156
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-3.2306
The agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no earlier criminal records .	-2.6940
" Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large part of them are criminal aliens .	-3.5465
" We continue to follow these people , " said Albence .	-3.7303
In an effort to speed up applications for children , officials introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention , not after 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to the accommodation staff .	-5.7807
Many will not appear in person , but through a video conference , in order to appeal to an immigration judge for legal status .	-5.5758
Those who are not eligible for discharge are quickly deported .	-3.0871
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely they are to be fearful or depressed , leading to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape .	-3.7917
Proponents have said that these concerns are being reinforced in a larger body such as Torillo , where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked because of their size .	-10.7149
They added that moving children to the tent city without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or leave friends could exacerbate a trauma that many are already struggling with .	-4.8197
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-1.9980
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-3.1893
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil on the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-4.7089
“ You must withdraw immediately unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.4944
Moualem argued harshly and firmly that in Syria , the “ war on terror is almost over . ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , and millions more have been displaced from their homes .	-4.1393
He said that Damascus will continue to “ fight this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence . ”	-3.7332
The US has around 2,000 troops in Syria , mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.7051
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-3.0116
On the refugee question , Moualem said that the conditions for return are fine , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears ” that drove refugees to stay away .	-5.5202
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return , ” says Moualem .	-3.0008
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-2.4764
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction aid for Syria if there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to an end to the war .	-4.3663
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib provides the opportunity to advance political talks .	-3.8688
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province in which three million people live .	-2.8772
Moualem , however , stressed that the agreement was “ clear deadlines , ” and he hopes that military action will be directed against jihadists , including militants from the Nusra Al Qaeda-linked front , who are “ wiped out . ”	-8.1412
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.5246
Moualem called conditions for the Syrian government ’ s participation in the committee : he said that the body ’ s work should be limited to “ reviewing the articles of the current constitution , ” and warned of interference .	-4.2864

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna .	-2.8380
The Rangers are the host to Rapid Wien on Thursday , knowing that the victory over the Austrians , following the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month , puts them in a strong position to qualify from Group G for the European League .	-4.4978
A knee injury prevented the midfield player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance in the season up to the 2nd draw against Villarreal , but he believes that the Rangers can use this score as a springboard for larger things .	-6.1153
“ This was a good point for us , because Villarreal is a capable team , ” said the 31-year-old .	-2.9250

The Federal Prosecutor calls for the rare death penalty for the terrorist attack in NYC .	-3.8911
Prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov , suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City , which killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the federal state since 1953 .	-4.0649
Saipov , 30 , allegedly used a Home Depot rental car in October for his attack on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan , where he struck pedestrians and cyclists .	-5.9192

Both charges can be claimed with death , according to court documents .	-5.1586

Paul Rowlett , an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice , has spent several hours as an expert on information evaluation .	-3.9951
He outlined for the jury how he assembled the movements of the 29-year-old defendant , Quinton Tellis , and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers , on the night of her death , on the basis of mobile phone recordings .	-5.4412
Rowlett said he received site data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the evening of her death , which contradicted his earlier claims , The Clarion Ledger reported .	-4.3453
The analysis of the data on Chambers cell phones revealed that he was in the company of his friend Michael Sanford , and Sanford was subsequently interrogated by the police .	-6.0199
Sanford said on Saturday that he was not in town on that day .	-3.0936
In response to the prosecutors ’ question of whether Tellis spent the night in Sanford ’ s truck , he replied that he lied because his truck was in Nashville at that time .	-4.1824
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said to have known Chambers for about two weeks when she died .	-1.9419
According to mobile phone records , they were only known for a week .	-3.8768
Rowlett said that , after Chambers ’ death , Tellis deleted text messages , call and contact information from his phone .	-3.1740
" He deleted them from his life , " Hale said .	-2.6196

Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman , a mother of two children , was dismayed to find out that her new child care scheme , Giselle Maurice , was black when she first began working in 2016 .	-4.1313
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a short communication : " Neiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii	-1.6516
Instead of sending him to her husband , she sent him twice to Mrs. Maurice .	-2.6198
After she had noticed her Patzer , a " uncomfortable " Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms Maurice and explained that her outgoing nanny , who was African-American , had done a bad job and that instead she wanted to hire a Filipino , New York Post said .	-6.5451
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her work in one day and then sent home for an Uber .	-3.9363
Now Maurice sued the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation of $ 350 a day for the six-month full-time job for which she was originally hired , albeit without a contract .	-6.4886
" I want to show them , look at them , do not do that , " she said to the post on Friday , adding : " I know that this is discrimination . "	-4.8483
The couple has given counter claims , saying that the decision to end Mauricio ’ s employment relationship was reasonable and that they acted for fear because they could not trust her after she insulted her .	-5.4499
" My wife sent her something she didn 't want to say .	-2.7493
It is not racist .	-0.5072
“ We are not racists , ” her husband Joel Plasco told the post .	-2.0681
" Would you entrust your children to someone whom you , if by mistake , insulted ?	-4.1504
Your newborn baby ?	-1.0406
Hardly . ”	-1.2919

Paddington publishers feared that readers could not identify with a talking bear , which unveiled a new letter .	-3.2916
Bond daughter Karen Jankel , born shortly after the adoption of the book , said about the letter : It is difficult to get someone to read it for the first time before the release .	-4.0826
“ It ’ s very amusing – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-2.1336
She said that her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman , and was then inspired to write a children ’ s book by a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , adding that the 60th anniversary of the book release after his death last year was “ bitter . ”	-5.1462
To Paddington , which she calls “ a very important family member , ” she says that her father was still proud of his eventual success .	-4.3617
" He was a rather quiet man , and he was not a boisterous person , " she said .	-3.8259
“ But , because Paddington was so genuine for him , it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something : you are proud of the child , even though it is not what you do .	-6.1270
I think he has seen Paddington 's success a little like that .	-2.4170
Although it was his creation and imagination , he always paid tribute to Paddington himself . ”	-3.2718

" Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad that she probably won 't , " said Ednan-Laperouse .	-5.0783
Then I got the call from Nad , in which she said she would die in the next two minutes , and I had to leave her .	-9.7064
And I did .	-1.1646
I said : " Tashi , I love you so much , treasure .	-1.4950

I will be with you . ”	-0.9431
The medicine that had given her the nerve to pump her heart further , slowly stopped and left her body .	-5.8296
She had died some time before , and that brought everything to a standstill .	-3.7266
I just had to sit there and wait , knowing what happens .	-2.3764
I could not howl or scream because I was surrounded in the situation by families and other people .	-2.4463
I really had to pull myself together .	-2.0408
Finally , Mrs Ednan-Laperouse , grieving about the loss of her daughter , went on board the aircraft with the other passengers , who did not know about the agony that she was experiencing .	-7.7163
“ No one knew anything , ” she said .	-1.9878
" I had lowered my head , and tears fell all the time .	-2.7157

“ I want no parent to feel like I do every day , ” she said .	-2.4949
Mrs. Davis , 45 years old and Lydia , described her son as a promising chef with contagious smile .	-3.2034
" He was known for his smile .	-1.4881
Everyone always said that his smile illuminated every room . ”	-3.1114
However , he had abandoned his job before his death because he was “ mentally very bad . ”	-4.6058
In 2014 , Tyler , who was eleven years old , found his brother after taking his life .	-2.7884
Mrs Davis said : ‘ I am constantly concerned that this could have a domino effect ’ .	-2.7925
Mrs Davis has made the cards ‘ to let people know that there is someone with whom they can talk , even if it is only a friend ’ .	-4.6789
Seat not quietly around - you have to talk . '	-3.9932
Mrs Humphreys , who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years , lost her partner Mark , with whom she was 15 years together , shortly before his mother died .	-5.8702

The FBI investigation has begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-2.2331
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he called for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps reach a little agreement , ” said Mr Flake on Saturday , adding that he fears that the committee will “ fall apart amid a deeply entrenched partisan blockade . ”	-7.4033
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate ?	-1.9412
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-2.2384
It is only five weeks before the midterm elections , and November 6 – if Republicans do badly , as expected , they will be severely weakened in an attempt to advance the man who has chosen the country ’ s highest court .	-7.4632
George W. Bush telephoned senators to persuade them to support Mr Kavanaugh , who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and met his wife Ashley , who was the personal secretary of Mr Bush .	-3.8838
What happens after the FBI report is published ?	-2.2101
The Senate , which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats , will vote .	-2.3444

The number of North Korea ’ s republicans has fallen under Kim	-4.9035
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , said a South Korean MP .	-2.4547
On the basis of data from the Department of South Integration , Park Byeong-seung stated that last year there was 1.127 of good news reports – compared to 2.706 in 2011 .	-6.7625
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in the prices of human traffickers play a major role in this .	-3.9219
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly .	-4.8032
After all , the majority of North Korean refugees receive South Korean citizenship .	-3.6770
Seoul is said to have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 .	-2.7988
Most are fleeing from China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea .	-3.6346
China views defectors as illegal migrants , not refugees , and often forcibly repatriate them .	-2.5806
Relations between the North and the South , which are formally still at war , have improved considerably in recent months .	-2.8718
Earlier this month , leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled negotiations on denuclearization .	-2.8469
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore , when they largely agreed on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula .	-3.8473
But on Saturday , North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for the lack of progress since then .	-2.4001
“ Without confidence in the US , our national security is at stake ; under these circumstances , unilateral disarmament is not possible on our part in the first step , ” Ri stated in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York .	-4.8275
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical , saying that he is unsuitable for serving the Supreme Court .	-2.9584
The leader of the Democratic minority group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , “ hysterical , ” the candidate for a Supreme Court seat , saying that he was not in a temperament to serve the Supreme Court .	-5.8316
Pelosi made the comments at an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.2061
“ I could not but think that if a woman had ever behaved like this , they would have called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Committee on Thursday .	-4.9989
Kavanaugh disproved the allegations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young   .	-4.0907
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he shouted almost and fought with tears when he talked about his family and his high school years .	-3.6528
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee , calling the charges against him a “ grotesque and coordinated campaign of call , ” organized by liberals angry at Clinton ’ s loss of the 2016 presidential election .	-4.5212
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh ’ s statement that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , because he showed that he was biased against democrats .	-3.3971
“ I believe that he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he can influence Clinton and Democrats , ” she said .	-4.4203
When asked whether , in the event of his confirmation and a Democratic majority in the House , she would seek impeachment against Kavanaugh , Pelosi hesitated .	-4.2492
“ I want to say this : if he does not tell the truth to neither Congress nor the FBI , he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court service , but also for the service in the court where he is currently engaged , ” said Pelosi .	-6.0326
Kavanaugh is currently the District Court of Appeals in D.C.	-5.2714
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. , because he stands for conservative justice .	-4.1273
In his verification hearings , Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions .	-4.0589
“ It is not the time that a hysterical , biased person goes to court and expects us to say , “ Is this not wonderful , ” Pelosi said .	-4.2911
And women must stand by .	-3.1205
It is a veritable idiom , months and years of anger , and it cannot get it out without crying .	-4.7315
" We weep when we get angry , " said Ms Steinem 45 years later to me .	-2.4356
'I do not think that is unusual , or ? '	-2.8516
She continued : “ Once a woman , in the executive , told me that she also cried when she became angry , but she developed a technique in which , every time she became angry and began to cry , she said to the person she spoke to : “ They may think that I am sad because I am crying .	-7.1651
I am angry . '	-1.3251
And then she simply continued .	-2.5247
And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.2740
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-3.0326
One of my strongest memories of an early job in an office dominated by men , where I once weeded with indescribable anger , was that I was wrapped up by an elderly woman , an disgusting manager before whom I was always scared - who dragged me into a stairwell .	-7.2245
" Never let them see you cry , " she told me .	-2.8349
" They do not know that you are angry .	-1.7752
They think you are sad and will be happy because they have caught you . ' '	-6.2735
Patricia Schroeder , then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado , had supported Gary Hart in his presidential campaign .	-2.5559
In 1987 , when it became known that Mr. Hart had an extramarital affair aboard a boat called “ Monkey Business , ” he was out of the race .	-4.2577
“ It was not a well-considered decision , ” she told me with a laugh 30 years later .	-3.5349
" There were seven more candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another .	-2.5993
Someone called it ' Snow White and the Seven Dwarves ' .	-2.0803
Because the campaign was already underway , it was lagging behind in funding , and so it swore that it would not participate in the race unless it collected $ 2 million .	-5.3770
It was a lost battle .	-1.3254
She found that some of her followers , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would give her only $ 250 .	-2.8656
“ Do they think , I get shortLauries ? ” she marveled .	-5.7588
When she made her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotion - gratitude to the people who supported her , frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and raise voters instead of delegates , and anger over sexism - that she was stifled .	-4.3805
“ One might think I had a nervous breakdown , ” Schroeder recalls how the press responded to it .	-3.7794
" It would have been thought that Kleenex is my company sponsor .	-2.4780
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone .	-1.9318

How the China-US Trade War Can Be Advantage of Beijing	-4.0397
The opening salves of the US-China trade war were deafening , and no end to the conflict is in sight . A gap between the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run , experts say .	-5.5459
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese exports , such as solar panels , steel , and aluminum .	-2.9292
The introduction of new tariffs on Chinese products imported into the US worth $ 200 billion ( <unk> 150 billion ) this week has led to a dramatic escalation of the situation .	-3.3924
Beijing has restored itself each time in the form of tangible benefits , and , most recently , tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $ 60 billion .	-7.1176
China answers every blow to the US , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second largest economy will yield in the near future .	-3.7653
Bringing Washington in means pandering to demands , but publicly bowing to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , the president of China .	-4.9466
But if Beijing makes good use of its opportunities , the trade war with the US can have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies , experts say .	-4.9425
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic turmoil in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers previously assumed , ” said Abigail Grace , a researcher at the Center for New American Security , a think tank focusing on Asia .	-4.2453
Syria is ' ready ' to return refugees , says the Foreign Minister .	-2.9074

Now all the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods .	-3.7976
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011 .	-2.0442
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid .	-2.5240
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country .	-2.6647
But he emphasized that he would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that financed the insurgency .	-2.6135
