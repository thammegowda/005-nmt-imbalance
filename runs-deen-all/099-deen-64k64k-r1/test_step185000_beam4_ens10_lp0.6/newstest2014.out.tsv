Good : More pedestrian safety	-4.9674
They are not 100 meters from each other : on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian shed at the village parking lot was opened in Gutach - in sight of the older Town Hall Hall Hall Hall Hall Hall .	-7.4361
Two systems so close to each other : Intent or shield line ?	-4.5682
Gutach ’ s mayor answered this question clearly yesterday .	-3.0314
" The Town Hall Hall was installed at the time because it secured the school path " , Eckert explained yesterday .	-4.8317
The traffic lights are safe for cyclists , bus passengers and mountain residents .	-5.0338
The plant , which was officially operational yesterday , is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e crossroads .	-4.0549
We have a museum , two churches , a spa park , a bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as a traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-4.6603
" At the high traffic and pedestrian traffic volumes a further traffic light had to be built for their safety " , Eckert said .	-5.9098
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the District Council of Offenburg .	-3.7964
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33 , of which about 10 % are heavy goods traffic , " stresses Arnold .	-5.8949
As a result , the construction of another set of traffic lights is more than necessary : " Safety just goes ahead " , Arnold says .	-6.8772
There were four traffic shows and a roundabout was also planned , but it was dropped due to the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e crossroads .	-7.9385
According to Arnold , everything was tested before when the traffic lights were selected : " With an extra transporter loaded for us with particularly long wooden trunks , we have determined whether these vehicles can drive out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without turning the traffic lights around " .	-8.6658
The € 15,000 amp system itself is the " most modern on the market , " explained Arnold .	-5.7604
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs , which shine so strongly that the lights can be easily recognized by car drivers , for example , even when the sun is low .	-7.4541
And it is economical : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new one just eight watts .	-5.2709
There are three lights per direction .	-2.1659
Arnold explained the technique of the new system : This is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.7537
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-4.1592
If the road is free , green comes directly for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.5323
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended .	-3.9750
" If a group or people with reduced mobility take to the streets , the green phase will be extended , so everyone can safely cross the road , " Arnold explained .	-7.4263
Of course the car driver has to think as a partner here and watch the road .	-5.6763
This was not the case yesterday : when the traffic lights showed green for pedestrians , a first-class vehicle crashed - with bright red .	-6.2886
For more than 30 years Josef Winkler has written the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-4.1777
The Kärntner poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - speechlessness , the propensity to brute force and blunt sexuality , the closeness and lack of joy .	-7.2355
The Büchner-Prize winner is particularly well known as a prose author , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-6.4108
Collage from Prosatextend Gerhard Fresacher brings together a collage of prose pieces for his performance " Wetter e e " , which can e in Garage   .  .	-8.6923
The theater maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Leibeigene " ( 1987 ) with prose directors from " Leischham , his family besieging " ( 2003 ) .	-5.4742
On the largely empty stage - important Requisit : a crumpled sofa , on which implicitly copied and splashed - the eight-member ensemble hangs through the text material .	-7.7413
Director Fredacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-4.3913
The 70-minute performance overtakes the original with a wealth of register infals , known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms .	-6.5410
The actors in particular come to the stage during the sometimes somewhat questionable performances .	-6.7125
They are touched hard , dipped with their head under water , with their evening robes tickled to the wall .	-6.4247
Forced into cellophan or bodice , they stick to dangerously high sticks through the staging , either monologize them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor .	-5.9118
The text , however , is hardly conveyed in this hard way .	-4.2201
The best moments are the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs .	-5.3606
It is only at the end that the overperformed performance comes to rest , and Winkler ’ s subsequent absurd humor flashes up .	-8.5100
A black box in the car ?	-1.0693
American street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling Highway system , and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of every car .	-5.8883
The devices that record every kilometer and report the information to the authorities are central to a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads .	-5.5112
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked intense debate with colorful alliances .	-3.7095
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the miles – and possibly where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax moderation .	-6.1395
The Tea Party is appalled .	-1.1215
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-3.4253
But , while congressional action cannot be agreed , several states are no longer waiting .	-3.9437
They are currently examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .	-4.4840
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.9581
This really is a must for our country .	-2.1296
“ It ’ s nothing that we may only use , ” said Hasan Ihrata , managing director of the Southern California Assn . of Governements , who plans to record the miles taken by all Californian motorists in the state from 2025 onwards .	-6.6155
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.3155
The technology is there .	-1.5814
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed by the taxes paid by Americans at the fuel dispensers , is bankrupt .	-4.1677
But America is no longer dancing as much as it used to be .	-4.4475
Cars consume less petrol .	-1.3381
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not risen for 20 years .	-2.9625
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by one cent at high fuel prices .	-4.3070
“ The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.0759
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a payments system based on miles .	-4.2197
“ That is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-7.2483
Bureaucrats call it a meillebased user fee .	-3.3133
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and harmful emissions from the climate .	-5.1638
California planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to meet the federal state ’ s ambitious , legally anchored climate change targets .	-5.9556
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also said that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.2252
The independent marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of paying drivers after a short distance .	-5.0488
“ This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice President of Policies at Reason .	-2.9720
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.7609
The movement is also supported by two previous US transport ministers , who , in a 2011 report , called on Congress to move toward meille-based accounting .	-5.5275
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars .	-2.7879
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of rural MPs representing people who often travel many miles to work or to the city in everyday life .	-5.8891
Several states and major cities nonetheless move in this direction on their own .	-3.5112
The most dedicated is Oregon , which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-4.1220
These drivers will soon pay the cost of miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state .	-4.4363
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.0876
New York City is also considering this .	-5.7303
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .	-3.4591
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the Department of Transportation of 17 East Coast states ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is now exploring how to introduce the change .	-8.2676
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.9153
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment , motorists were skeptical about the government ’ s ability to follow any of its movements .	-4.6586
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” says Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Department of Transportation in Nevada .	-4.1878
People did not want it .	-1.4666
When the test started , the Nevada ACLU warned on its website , “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into full-fledged surveillance devices . ”	-4.1813
There is no need to build a gigantic , unwieldy technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to gather data about individuals ’ daily movements .	-3.2090
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the kilometres travelled , but not exactly when and where .	-4.6666
That , Khan said , would also reassure the public .	-3.6239
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California .	-3.7390
The company originally did not plan to help states tax drivers .	-4.6065
Rather , it was its goal to gain traction in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers are to pay on the basis of mileage .	-6.8339
However , the devices they test are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem .	-5.5142
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-3.6855
Some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes .	-2.9373
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .	-2.6054
In Oregon , planners are experimenting with offering motorists a variety of choices .	-3.8748
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.8773
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles travelled by all state residents .	-5.0421
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by providing the devices with more functions than with less .	-5.4289
In New York City , road officials want to develop a tax system that also pays parking fees , pays insurance only for kilometres travelled , and collects speed data from other vehicles in real time , enabling motorists to avoid traffic jams .	-7.1136
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” says a city planning document .	-3.6519
However , some road planners wonder whether all the talk of paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-4.1819
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax .	-3.9423
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use less petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-5.1305
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” says Randy Rentschler , the Commission ’ s head of legislation and public affairs .	-5.1740
If we do that , hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and many other things .	-3.2765
Königsfeld : Small Team Strikes	-3.4176
The volunteer fire brigade handled their autumn rehearsal with flying colours despite lack of manpower .	-5.2417
Only eleven men participated in the exercise .	-2.1073
Commander Hans Kammerer chose the property in Burgberger Stra<unk>e in his acceptance of training .	-5.7211
There a short circuit should have been created during sawing .	-5.7981
Two people were injured as a result of the fire and the smoke development , but one of them was able to send an emergency call .	-5.6692
After Hans Kammerer ’ s first review of the situation , two guards of the defence were ready to enter the building .	-7.1384
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and guide them into the open .	-5.6786
The second person had to be worn .	-1.1812
This was not so easy as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome .	-4.7711
The building , a workshop with integrated housing for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.4745
There was a lot of wood and a lot of straw .	-4.5395
There were also electric machines for woodworking .	-3.4992
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle .	-3.2865
Another line was via an overflight hydrant about 100 meters away .	-5.4194
Three fire attacks were now possible .	-3.7874
A hollow pipe was also used in the building .	-2.5749
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what to do with little available personnel .	-4.7254
In case of emergency , support is provided via the Königsfeld daily operation group .	-4.5914
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .	-3.2216
Networking of universities and firms Important	-3.5483
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald , state president Guido Wolf was also able to explain in Titisee Neustadt about where the workforce of tomorrow comes from .	-6.6406
At the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum , he studied this important issue together with the heads of business at vocational schools , the Kreisgymnasium and the chairman of the board of directors .	-8.3805
" Education is an important location factor , " said Claudia Standle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked Hochschwarzwald Education Centre project .	-5.3907
Wolf was impressed by the model projects on training .	-3.4843
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderstadt , Kreisgymnasium and Berufsschulzentrum .	-6.3744
He also praised the family-friendliness of the county .	-3.4677
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also , due to demographic change , the phase of care for relatives , " said Wolf .	-6.0068
He also suggested that more and more employees care about the care and care of their loved ones .	-4.7862
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment , " said Wolf .	-4.1163
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers , he continued .	-2.9435
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.7363
" Those who have already experienced the advantages of the region during their studies , with their acquired knowledge and skills , often remain in the regional economy , contributing to the strengthening of the region , " said the state president .	-7.6163
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the needs of skilled workers be met .	-4.3359
In his opinion , the region ’ s location advantage is its favourable location in the south-west of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.3476
In addition , on his journey from Titisee Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made for the development of local public transport .	-5.4863
" Stay firm and make public transport better , " he said to the local politicians present .	-5.5937
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music	-2.6771
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cake and afterwards to a Vesper .	-4.9126
In the past , the elderly were accommodated in the resting place .	-4.9303
In the meantime this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Josef .	-3.9758
Home residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-4.4582
Later there was a sausage salad .	-3.2957
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were playing with popular melodies .	-5.3798
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school yard to the Kirchstra<unk>e , which is in front of the renovation , is to be set once again on the redevelopment plan of the town of Bräunlingen .	-9.3626
In the days before the Kilbig , during the first work on the renovation of the front school yard , a small angle wall was built to stabilize and stabilize the 100 year old stone wall with balustrade .	-8.0083
According to Alexander Misok of the Bränlinger Stadtbauamt , the Federal Office for Monument Protection is to be included in the plans and to create a redevelopment concept for the old wall .	-8.4077
It will then be a cost calculation by experts , who will then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine the way forward .	-7.5197
A decision on this will probably be taken next year .	-2.9441
After the renovation , paving and planting of the old school interior within the two wings of the school built in 1912 , the demolition wall needs to be completely renovated and placed on new foundations in the foreseeable future .	-7.3420
The historic , 100-year-old barrier wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e is in need of repair , mainly due to damage to water and frost , as there is no drainage , and has a tendency towards arches .	-8.2372
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage , but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse .	-5.1711
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students using Schulhof , which has been done through the current fixing work .	-6.9637
Originally , the school ’ s renovation was planned even in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure brought a shift .	-6.4971
An important word in the historical restoration of school masonry , which has even been used for film recordings , will be heard by the National Historic Office .	-7.8296
Should guidelines come from this side , the town of Bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the conservationists .	-6.2047
The students of the Bränlinger Primary School , who are now teaching again in a well renovated old school building with a new Aula , can soon use the old school yard .	-7.0995
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart .	-1.9776
Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now become involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-7.4638
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart , " said <unk>zdemir of the " Stuttgarter Nachrichten " .	-4.4400
Jazz and classical music belong together at the Jazz-location Stuttgart .	-3.8254
In this way , <unk>zdemir , who is the favorite for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22 September in Stuttgart , is opposed to the Green Red Government  .      e .	-9.6226
Based on an expert study , these forces a new order of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.9447
After that , among other things , the degree course jazz and pop is to be shifted from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim .	-5.6438
US border : " super tunnel " to drug smuggling discovered .	-4.1823
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and closed a " super tunnel " to drug smuggling .	-3.4273
As US customs officials said , the more than 500 meter long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks , and a ventilation system .	-4.3161
Three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.7871
According to the data , the tunnel had not yet been used .	-2.8009
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves under the radar , " said the Attorney General of the District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where an end to the tunnel had been discovered .	-5.4478
Turning to the drug gangs , Duffy assured : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-5.0976
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent war against the drug cartels .	-2.7879
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime .	-2.3194
Designed by Experts	-2.0384
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that it took about a year .	-4.8123
The track position was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there .	-3.8736
On the Mexican side , access is in a building 80 meters from the border .	-3.9526
According to the authorities , a ladder leads to the actual tunnel entrance 20 metres in depth .	-5.0825
The tunnel has a cross section of 1,20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width .	-3.2055
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-3.7338
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with cocaine .	-1.9321
The third , a Mexican , was caught because of the confiscated marijuana .	-3.0338
All three are in danger of being deprived of life as a maximum sentence , as officials have said .	-6.6780
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-3.4036
But it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction .	-3.1362
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not through tunnels .	-2.6089
This shows the " despair " of drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the drug trail DEA in San Diego .	-4.5593
They would do all they can to reach the US .	-2.9619
No details were disclosed about the detainees , at least one was Mexican .	-3.8502
They are expected to have prison sentences of up to ten years .	-3.5311
2014 : Geisinger Festjahr	-5.3869
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-2.7397
The return of the first records is approaching .	-4.0403
If the year ends in just over eight weeks , the anniversary year will begin .	-4.8096
The first documented mention of violins and church houses was in 794 .	-4.7390
In churches a document was produced in which both places are mentioned .	-4.6823
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently does not have a hall , this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-6.9475
As part of the anniversary , several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church houses .	-5.0888
Church houses will be the 1250 in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July .	-5.2126
Celebrate the return .	-3.2688
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle .	-3.3867
There is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest on this festival weekend .	-5.1255
On the occasion of its anniversary , city music director Rudolf Barth wrote a composition for the city , which will be performed on three dates .	-5.7449
On June 21 together with the Black Forest Association 's Sonnwend Party , on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-6.1767
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date will be on the last weekend of September , on 27 and 28 September .	-4.6590
A new chronicle will also be released on the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary .        .  ,	-8.0028
" It should be a chronicle not only by Geisingen himself , but also a printed work on the violin of today , which consists of violin , church houses , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen " , says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-7.0780
And today ’ s violinion is celebrating its birthday in 2014 , and in 1974 the present space was completed with the approval .	-7.8840
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new Festhalle in Geisingen .	-3.0631
2014 , however , is another year of many anniversaries . , , or . or or .	-6.5433
The Narrennization of straw begins on 8 February with a traditional feast on the occasion of its 60-year anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will celebrate the Festbankett on 29 March and then the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May .	-8.4967
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old , the Geissinger school has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July .	-6.3746
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in documents in 764 in a deed of donation , which is in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen .	-4.9458
The document was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was then a court .	-4.9029
Both communities are mentioned in the same document .	-2.5474
The reason to celebrate this 125-year old year in 2014 is that the municipal council reform is also 40 years old .	-10.0281
Council Targeting Rail Systems	-5.3817
Should the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " be painstakingly rebuilt in order to improve road safety ?	-4.8068
Yes , the local councils have decided .	-1.9634
Schiltach must have EUR 220 000 in his hand .	-3.7578
The Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal line next year .	-4.9149
Especially the safety of railway crossings is to be increased - there are frequent collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout Germany .	-6.4591
If the communities agree to the conversion measures , they will have to take part in the costs by a third , while the rest will be divided by the railway and the federal government .	-8.4991
Schiltach ’ s master builder Roland Grie<unk>haber explained to the local council the special features of the “ Am Hirschen ” golf course .	-5.5416
There , the city plans to build a settlement to the west of the railway tracks up to the tunnel .	-7.1102
There , even larger vehicles , such as those transporting longwood , could stand on the ground without having to block the track .	-6.5886
Grie<unk>haber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-5.7457
This was controversial in the municipal council , as some councils questioned the need for road distribution : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , pointed out the critics ' mood : ' Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles ? '	-8.5675
Mayor Thomas Haas said : The railway crossing " Hirschen " is regularly used for the transport of long timber .	-5.4583
Even wood from the area " Kuhbach " is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there .	-5.9575
In addition , the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-4.3515
As it is to be expected that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway crossing " Am " Hirschen " could also have an important significance for transport for a longer period of time .	-7.4337
The councils agreed to let investigate the costs of the planned widening of the road .	-4.7014
Despite this , the conversion of the railway crossing was agreed by a majority , with the proviso that the necessary support wall would be built in such a way that the city could expand the next road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " , if necessary , to approximately 5.5 metres for the meeting traffic .	-10.2634
On the other hand , the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the tannery Trautwein could lead to a quite different problem , which concerns access to the " Geroltzhäuser Weg " , which is rising rapidly .	-8.5176
The management had to investigate the reconstruction plans of the railway by the engineering company Breinger , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegs was possible without further ado .	-7.1437
The result of the investigation was that it was not possible to rule out the possibility that the slope conditions of the road could lead to the suspension of longer vehicles .	-7.5235
The city , in turn , bears responsibility for this as a road haulage contractor .	-4.9598
The reconstruction could therefore lead to liability disputes .	-3.7076
Since both the logging and the turning worked in the current condition , one should not agree to the reconstruction of the railway crossing , Haas argued .	-7.3315
Also , at this point , the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is much lower than at the other railway crossings , because the center stop is right next to it , to which there is a good visual connection .	-8.5998
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be stopped to the point where there was no collision .	-6.8684
On several occasions , the reconstruction of this railway crossing was refused approval , as the town of Schiltach had to " take over " the problem of rolling out vehicles , according to the councils , as the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the completion of the construction work .	-10.5889
The panel considers the changes on the railway crossings " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhlbach " , for which crossing agreements have already been concluded with the railways .	-6.5857
Esa decides on big space missions : missions for billions .	-2.3771
Far off planets , gravitational waves or black holes - European space agency experts must now agree on two major projects that they intend to launch in the coming years .	-5.4623
30 suggestions were available , five are still in the race .	-3.5495
Far worlds .	-1.1262
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars .	-2.1149
No one knows whether there is any life , at least in some of them .	-4.7705
The choice is difficult : should you search for gravitational waves ?	-4.3948
Or rather explore the origins of the cosmos ?	-1.7686
Or to search for earthlike planets and thus perhaps discover extra-terrestrial life ?	-4.9452
These are the questions raised by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa .	-4.1199
For their " Cosmic Vision " program , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research .	-5.8885
The budget for such " L missions " is about one billion euros each .	-2.9605
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-2.0139
At the beginning of September the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-6.6144
Thirty ideas were on the table , five of which have now been shortlisted .	-4.3545
Many bodies are examining the proposals and following the advice of researchers .	-4.7195
A final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee in the next few days .	-3.4336
The Esa has selected four major questions to which the missions of the 2007 program " Cosmic Vision " will find answers .	-5.2500
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?	-2.1872
The exact processes of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-5.5649
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .	-2.1423
And when a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life be created there ?	-5.4000
To address this question , the Space Telescope " Cheops " will be launched in 2017 , which will examine more closely 500 known planetary systems in our vicinity .	-7.0123
The possibilities are limited , however , Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-3.0829
With larger instruments , astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indication of biological activity .	-4.3354
How does the solar system work ?	-0.8967
This question , too , is ultimately intended to shed light on the conditions for the emergence of life .	-4.8887
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role in the interaction of its magnetic field and particle radiation with the planetary system .	-3.8079
In our solar system , these processes can be investigated in an exemplary way .	-5.7881
With the Solar Orbiter , the Esa has already approved a M-Class mission ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.9310
The probe will launch in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun .	-3.5495
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers .	-2.1745
You want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-2.7281
This is the first of the three L missions of the " Cosmic Vision " program .	-3.8480
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .	-4.0376
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is said to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-3.8987
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.9297
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there .	-4.8137
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .	-4.9831
How was the universe created and what is it made of ?	-3.6785
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the big bang .	-2.7791
In addition to the common matter of stars , planets , and creatures like us , dark matter holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of space .	-5.9170
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first split seconds of the Big Bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy existed .	-5.6441
With Euclid , the Esa has already approved a M mission to launch in 2020 .	-4.9849
With a special telescope , the probe is intended for the first time to examine the distribution of matter in the universe throughout the sky , allowing conclusions about the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy .	-6.7491
Who Could Race	-1.8972
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-5.2382
In the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , the best chances for an L-mission approval has a challenging concept for the detection of gravitational waves .	-9.0731
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-2.9305
They have not yet been rejected .	-3.4149
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .	-2.9684
The mission envisages a detector consisting of two or three probes , which will be stationed in space .	-4.3114
In contrast to Earth 's facilities , it could also prove gravitational waves that were created during the Big Bang , providing new insights into the universe 's development .	-8.5866
Four other proposals still compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure cosmic background radiation , and the " Exopoplanet Finder " , which is supposed to detect and study Earth like planets .	-6.2515
Some of the proposals for sample return transport from Mars , for research on moon , Venus and asteroids , and for solar physics have already been withdrawn .	-8.9573
Snowden is ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance .	-2.7314
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has said that he is willing to travel to Berlin and say to the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director , Keith Alexander , do not provide answers about their activities .	-5.6668
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where he received asylum to discuss with him what he said in Germany .	-3.6517
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele , he writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a fiefdom and seeks to criminalize political expression with threats of punishment where no defense is possible . ”	-7.2577
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.2885
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to drop the charge .	-4.9067
The charge issued by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property .	-3.1181
Germany ’ s interior minister , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said online to Time : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . ”	-5.0828
Relations between the US and Germany are strained by claims that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s cellphone had been intercepted by the NSA .	-4.4557
Thomas Oppermann , the member who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services , said that he should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , “ without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US . ”	-5.9211
Ströbele , a Green MEP , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.5770
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.8085
Ströbele explained that , according to former NSA member Snowden ’ s lawyer , he could not return to Russia if he left the country .	-3.9936
If Snowden is telling in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe , ” he said .	-4.4210
Snowden explains in his letter that he would face a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that drove him out of his homeland .	-4.0188
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.7752
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a public benefit .	-5.0288
In his letter , Snowden offered the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation were resolved . ”	-3.9473
Frontier Airlines charges cabin baggage charges	-1.9584
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers wishing to pack their hand baggage on their flight .	-4.0233
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for one piece of hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even though the announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers should keep the whole can .	-5.0725
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , and small bags under the seat remain free of charge .	-3.8125
Frontier explained that if you pay the fee in advance , you will be charged $ 25 and $ 100 for passengers who only paid at the boarding gate .	-6.4645
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said the fee of $ 100 targets to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance .	-4.6726
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-4.4439
Airlines started charging for the first and second items of baggage in 2008 .	-3.2659
Passengers who have tried to bypass these have therefore packed as much as possible in their hand baggage , which means that the baggage compartments above the seat are often crowded .	-6.2913
Charges are a way of getting passengers to take less on board .	-3.0625
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .	-1.8499
These are the most loyal customers of Frontier , who have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the field above the seat .	-6.2041
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay .	-2.9641
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of baggage free of charge at Frontier 's boarding gate , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .	-5.5074
O 'Malley stated that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the charge before coming to the boarding gate .	-4.6044
Frontier 's new hand baggage charge will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no exact date yet .	-4.6811
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines are happy to resort to this .	-5.4175
They argue that transporting luggage should cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they so wish .	-3.5483
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses .	-3.6272
However , most of them have so far left the fingers of charges for hand baggage .	-5.2993
Three years ago , Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded first hand baggage charges and later , Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline , followed .	-6.4935
The only other airline with such a charge would be the Hungarian Wizz Air , the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-4.8265
In a report of December 2011 , he estimated that Spirit ’ s hand baggage charge would raise $ 50 million annually .	-4.3112
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected at the boarding gate if passengers were confronted with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge .	-5.9351
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I have experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-3.3140
I expected to see ponderous and tangible discussions at the boarding gate .	-3.8902
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding was like a forge . ”	-3.4182
Frontier also follows Spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .	-4.5334
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and coffee is being filled free of charge .	-5.4538
Water remains free .	-1.0695
In 2008 , US Airways briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks , but cancelled it seven months later , after passengers complained and no other large company had left .	-6.9537
Frontier ’ s step to charge for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-5.3095
Carriers pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold .	-2.7292
This gives all companies an incentive to take passengers directly to them rather than via an online travel agency .	-5.0435
Frontier , however , has gone furthest in this area .	-2.3516
In September , the company started to award half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.6492
On Wednesday , miles were again reduced to 25 % of the route .	-3.3992
For this reason , a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third party will only earn customers 250 miles .	-5.8664
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly on the Frontier website .	-4.2970
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .	-3.5010
The revenues declined by 9 percent , and flight capacity declined by just under 13 percent in the first quarter , as reported in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-5.4388
Republic has tried to control Frontier 's finances as part of the sale of society .	-3.7720
Proven Words Coming from the Bible	-3.8526
About 40 women visited the last breakfast for women this year in the protestant parish of Bisingen .	-3.9153
The theme of the day at the Municipal House was " Proven<unk>al Word from the Bible " and " Medieval Word " .	-5.5665
After breakfast , Zita Köhler , Chairman of the Church Council , spoke about biblical sayings .	-5.0363
" Proven words contain life wisdom , rules , or warnings , " she explained .	-5.0723
She compared several sayings with the corresponding Biblical passages and explained the meaning .	-3.5836
She called sayings such as : wooden eye is vigilant , as dandruff falls from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his own the Lord in sleep to wash his hands of it .	-7.3505
On several occasions , the speaker also advised their listeners what the saying was .	-5.1837
Christel Dehner ’ s Church Church Fathers accepted the idiom of the Middle Ages : All good things are three , make blue , make something look like .	-8.6189
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called " bridges to the past " .	-2.7327
A raffle was completed .	-3.2039
The prizes were covered on a table and were described in a humorous manner before they were handed over to the winners .	-5.2443
Among the visitors of the breakfast round , the mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger also mixed .	-5.6637
Learning instead of Unemployment : Pilot project for Unlearned Tourism	-4.0127
A pilot project for the tourism industry starts at the Mecklenburg Lake District .	-4.1854
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winter months .	-5.4820
" What is new is that the six-month courses will end , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Arbeitsagentur Neubrandenburg .	-4.2470
The benefits are manifold : the participants would not be unemployed , the companies would receive trained professionals , who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-5.4062
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Deoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-4.6095
NSA states that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the web site crash .	-3.9089
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that a bug has stalled its public website for some hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-5.5165
" NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update , " explained the spy agency in an e-mail message .	-5.6982
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.9309
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.1544
In the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that this is still not available to some users .	-4.5239
Previously , a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way compromised . ”	-3.4986
Secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .	-2.8331
At least one group of hackers claimed to have crippled the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.9861
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .	-4.0784
Cybertactic is relatively simple , and the attacks are not designed to enter the target system 's internal network .	-4.8649
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname was once the No Search Agency ( no such agency ) , is now in the spotlight of the public and is exposed to sharp criticism after the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extended surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-12.5517
The growing controversy surrounding the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-4.0546
The number of people without jobs fell slightly in October by 22 to 1.307 .	-3.2816
Although the 3.1 % quota is better than last year and better than in September , " we had hoped for more , " says Monika Felder-Bauer , deputy chief executive of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen .	-5.0779
Many farms have reacted so far in attitudes .	-3.7711
According to Felder-Bauer , one reason for this is that we have few skilled workers in the craft , health care and care of the elderly .	-5.0350
Employment opportunities for staff in the hotel and catering industry have been in operation since September .	-6.0649
The winter season starts in mid-December .	-2.6056

Bombardier ’ s loss of earnings following a decline in delivery numbers and orders .	-3.9949
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decline in net profit on Thursday after falling orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway sector .	-5.6444
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft , and did not give any new information as to whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-6.2073
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago was followed by only three further launches , which makes it doubtful whether the test phase is as planned .	-6.1297
The results fell short of the forecasts and led to a drop of more than 8 % on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-5.1866
Cameron Doerksen , an analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his assessment on Thursday from “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” with a view to the stock ’ s limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-6.3176
“ Although weaker delivery figures were expected to meet the expectations of aircraft as much as possible , we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-7.7515
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the test programme for the aircraft progresses .	-4.3114
However , if new orders are not announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-3.0816
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series will catapult the company into the lower market segment , which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-3.7587
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays .	-2.6065
But binding orders for the CSeries have been moderate to 177 , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet aircraft are correct .	-5.8601
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.5007
Chief Executive Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the aircraft .	-3.4677
The management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was on schedule .	-4.1898
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference , adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft ’ s lifetimes .	-5.2572
Each manufacturer is planning differently .	-2.8377
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period , as we have done .	-4.3427
This is happening throughout the programme .	-2.2475
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , and the rest will soon be announced by the company .	-5.7043
However , analysts remain sceptical as to whether a CSeries aircraft can be operated 12 months after the maiden flight .	-4.3477
Bombardier explained that it will review the planning for the commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-4.9318
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if it appears to be in line with Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-5.8060
In the third quarter , with the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net gain fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-7.3065
The adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at 9 cents .	-2.7452
Sales declined slightly from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars .	-2.2409
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-7.7642
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-4.0190
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.5568
The order book in the aerospace sector stood at $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , unchanged from December 31 .	-3.1330
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were in line with our targets , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.8926
Revenues in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $ 2 billion .	-2.4208
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector increased by nearly 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.5568
The order book in the transport segment stood at $ 32.6 billion on September 30 , slightly increasing compared to December 31 .	-4.3895
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-4.1247
According to the management , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .	-3.6784
On Thursday ’ s Wednesday trading , the Bombardier share dropped by 8.5 % and was $ 4.83 Canadian , after it was announced that Google ’ s Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will change to the Board of Directors .	-6.8947
Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier ’ s closest rival , reported a 10 % drop in quarterly earnings on Thursday .	-2.9842
The United States at Los Angeles Airport	-4.3125

The LAX airport in Los Angeles is the largest airport in the United States .	-3.5767
Cocaine dependent lawyer who warned drug lords against police investigation must go to prison .	-4.3623
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave further information to Neil Scarborough , the world ’ s smallest .	-9.0816
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction might come to light .	-2.4094
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-1.6031
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug barons of a major police investigation for fear that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison .	-5.1529
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-4.6074
The lawyer , nicknamed “ bash , ” praised by criminists as “ first-class , ” was arrested in 2011 after the police had supervised Scarborough , which he had represented in a previous drug trial .	-7.5063
Officials watched Scarborough ( 32 ) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer ’ s house in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a bar meal .	-3.7607
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet , and on credit cards .	-3.9271
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he sought to obtain illicit information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-3.5718
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.5240
Together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police secured <unk> 1.5 million and <unk> 200,000 in cash in a series of house searches of heroin and cocaine .	-4.8586
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicised .	-4.0656
Today , Ditta , working for Forbes ’ s Solicitors ’ Office in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted of obstruction of justice at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial .	-5.5518
He admitted cocaine ownership in a previous survey .	-3.2589
The lawyer was convicted after the police found in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.6756
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house , where the drugs , with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove , were placed under the lawyer ’ s dustbin .	-6.2504
Shortly after he delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-9.8960
The lawyer returned home , picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two .	-3.1724
In court , it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests of class A drugs had been discovered in his hair , wallet , and on his credit cards .	-4.8436
Ditta was later arrested , but refused to take cocaine , saying that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client , claiming that their discussion was subject to “ legal secrecy . ”	-5.6610
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him .	-4.1540
In police interrogation , he stated that he was operating an office both at his private address and at work , and clients would call him at home for legal matters .	-6.7018
It was announced in court that he had called on key actors in the drug trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed the investigators of what they knew .	-6.3752
Attorney Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-3.1359
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has entered into too much with certain clients .	-5.0672
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-3.2138
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advocate of these people .	-4.1036
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-3.1424
He acted as far as possible to the police investigations , so that they could continue their criminal activities .	-4.8990
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute .	-2.6284
He was too close to certain clients , particularly Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.3604
Ditta dismissed every wrongdoing , claiming that “ if I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-5.0667
But , after the hearing , Supersintendent Lee Halstead of the Police in Lancashire said , “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals . ”	-5.9115
His cocaine addiction resulted in a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .	-4.0578
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence .	-2.8115
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the fa<unk>ade of his profession .	-3.5539
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit in Lancashire led the investigation of Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and the obstruction of justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-5.8763
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .	-2.8238
We will find you and bring you to justice .	-1.8843
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guilty of conspiracy to the heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .	-3.9078
Thirty-five more people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to total 153 years of drug offences .	-5.3937
On his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , suggesting that his dream job is to represent clients on death row in America , that his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali , and that inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-5.4211
The Revolutionary Works of Church Music	-2.5203
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary , the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services of worship with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.9540
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which impressed the audience in the spring of this year , the Liederkranz will enrich two services with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year .	-5.5153
On Saturday , October 26 , this extraordinary fair will be held from 19 : 00 at the evening fair in the St. Martinus Church in Dunningen and on Sunday , October 27 , at 10 : 15 at the church of St. Johannes Baptist in Laczendorf .	-6.8344
The so called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Songs for the celebration of the holy victim of the exhibition " , D 872 , is a sacred music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation .	-6.6289
The exhibition will be performed within the framework of services , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann intended .	-5.1978
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ .	-3.7389
Hashla ’ s Skepticism Meets Confidence	-6.1141
The 2015 elections to the parish council will change fundamentally , for example , in Haslach ( SE ) , the ministry of the sea .	-5.7332
There is then only one parish council for all six parishes .	-4.1623
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischenbach , Steinach and Welschsteinach prepared for the changes .	-4.3946
There is no need to change the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-5.7694
In the course of the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new is slowly giving way to confidence .	-5.4085
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main members of the ministry of the sea were enough .	-7.0889
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for pastoral care in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .	-5.4050
In the future , the SE Haslach as a parish will form a body of public law that will enter the rights and duties of the six individual church communities so far .	-6.1849
There will only be a common parish council and a council of foundations in which the parish priest is represented .	-5.1125
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish , with the six parishes forming so-called local teams .	-6.2715
Their task will in future be to promote church life in the village .	-3.9668
When asked about the finances of the individual parish , there was considerable need for discussion .	-4.9459
The innovations mean that accumulated funds in the parishes will be earmarked for purpose .	-7.0693
The liabilities , on the other hand , go to the community as a whole .	-6.2895
There was a great deal of concern , particularly with regard to the large investments planned , the commitment of which will affect all parishes .	-7.4789
" In the past , too , only investments were made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone " , relativized Haslach 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-6.0019
A practical experience with a joint body for five parishes , Barbar Ritter , the chairman of the board in the ministry of the Schutterwald-Neuried region .	-8.4323
In 2006 , they had set themselves the task of " becoming one , staying five " and found that this is not so easy .	-6.0028
The bodies of the Haslacher ministry of the sea were then prepared to answer the questions on the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams . or or or or or al al . al al al al al	-10.5760
The developments will be made concrete in further meetings and will be adopted at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-6.0377
In the end , parish priest Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the ministry unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-4.9956
The cost of electricity in Pfullendorf	-1.7162
The citizens of Pfullendorfs must prepare for higher electricity costs .	-3.3750
As the manager of the Stadtwerke , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to SUEDKURIER , an additional cost of EUR 70 to 90 per year is increased to a four-person Pfullendorfer family .	-5.6198
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.6784
This levy will be revised every year in October by the four operators of the major electricity routes .	-6.0089
These figures indicate the additional costs they incur from the change in energy , which they can charge above the cost of electricity by means of a levy .	-6.9475
The Pfullendorf Stadtwerke are the last link in this chain .	-2.6069
The Supervisory Board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.1900
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-4.3467
" We are expecting an increase of 1 cent plus x , " said Bias , with the figure closer to 2 cents .	-4.8865
Time to Wait	-4.3654
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not turn green .	-3.2362
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-3.0104
What to do - drive to red ?	-4.2081
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-5.6264
However , the waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-4.6264
Becker advises you to wait at least five minutes before starting a malfunction at the traffic lights .	-5.5866
However , if you continue the ride despite the red lights , you must be aware that you are entirely responsible for an accident .	-6.9053
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and points to a decision by the Supreme Court of Hamm .	-4.5573
In the trial case , a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a careless red light violation .	-5.5146
The room was very clean and comfortable .	-6.6994
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine .	-3.9401
Councillor looks forward to a sound budget	-5.4446
Whenever municipal council meetings are about the budget , Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh .	-9.8116
The municipal council in Herdwwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known any more since 2005 .	-6.3531
The 2012 financial year can also be seen as a full success in this respect .	-4.1358
This was evident when the annual accounts were presented for 2012 .	-3.6437
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget , amounting to around EUR 7.6 million , was over EUR 1 million higher than planned .	-4.5679
The surplus in the administrative budget , which amounts to around EUR 1.8 million , is also about EUR 1 million above the approach .	-5.7298
The surplus is mainly due to higher trade tax revenue and the community share of income tax .	-5.1507
The asset budget , too , was well above the planned values .	-4.6250
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.9663
" This is mainly due to the increased input from the administrative budget , " said Rothmund .	-3.9516
As less investment was made in the 2012 financial year than planned , the allocation of reserves has also been higher .	-5.5105
Overall , the overall reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now .	-3.4365
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-2.0101
" You don 't just shake off your sleeves , " Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts .	-5.5506
He and the local councils were obviously delighted with the good figures .	-3.6697
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dearly .	-4.2014
Due to the good financial situation , the municipality has in the past been able to avoid high lifting rates .	-5.9281
However , according to Gerster , subsidies have been cut several times by the country .	-5.1221
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory stocks .	-4.4475
Among other things , the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates .	-4.6178
" We need to look at the issue of lifting rates , because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to have subsidies , " Gerster said .	-6.2603
Nagold : Hugo Werfief in the choir for 60 years .	-3.3235
With 60 years as a singer Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the male choir Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the herbfest , in which he was solemnly honored .	-6.7196
As usual , Hubert Werframed stood on the stage in the colors of his men ’ s club .	-7.7264
After 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir , which is now probably more than dear .	-6.8618
Werfelder was also active in the association , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .	-4.8260
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association : Jörg Kohr , Pastoralreferent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate from the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .	-10.2076
His colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German choir association and a engraved tin plate .	-4.4778
In addition to the award , the 31st Autumn Festival went on its way : With the MGV amount , the Salzstetten Liederkranz , the Baingen singers ’ department and the local music club , the all-mariners had loaded a colourful mix of different choirs and vocal styles , which the around 400 visitors had .	-11.7155
The MGV full maringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " Im Weinparadise " and " Lustig , her brothers " .	-4.8255
Her honorary singer Hubert Werfelder also prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-6.1487
The men 's singing association Anger also sang classical choral songs such as " Jägerwerfer " by Julius Wengert , " weit , weit weg " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-6.3018
The Liederkranz Salzstetten , with its mixed choir and its group of women - the " Impulsionchor " - ensured the women 's quota of the festival .	-6.3730
The mixed choir , with the Neapolitan folk style of " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " , directed by Antos Gus to foreign countries , while the " Impulsionchor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of their programme .	-7.3341
The singer department of the Bainger Sports Association returned to the home of Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papberts " Bierlied " , where the Vollmaringer Musikverein was the crowning musical event .	-8.6065
For the children there was a small side program - " Grandma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollstein performed a Kasseltheater and read a few stories , which the children spent the lunch about well .	-8.4844

Helpers can be parents , grandparents , friends , clubs and , of course , the educators and children themselves .	-2.7953
Kenya ’ s press outraged by controversial media law	-3.3872
“ We are in a frightening situation , and one might ask : what does Parliament think about doing away with judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional .	-6.9697
“ The law is draconian and very criminal and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Capital Group ’ s managing director , CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .	-4.6326
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extension of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-2.7685
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-3.1268
According to The Star , the new law “ effectively puts the government in a stranglehold on the media , ” while The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Speech in Kenya have “ suffered a heavy blow , ” and called the draft “ draconian . ”	-5.8372
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September .	-4.4360
The Kenyan media aroused the anger of the authorities because they published photographs of security cameras on which the units sent to the scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping centre .	-6.5831
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by interrogation of two journalists and a leading media representative , even though the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry .	-4.3967
Under the new law , media houses can be fined as much as 20 million Kenyan Schillings , and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-5.5141
The tribunal also has the right to seize the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.8235
According to the Daily Nation , “ a single penalty can bankrupt most radio stations . ”	-3.0865
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya ’ s “ animated blogosphere . ”	-3.3125
If they silence the media , politicians could do whatever they want with impunity .	-2.0421
“ No one will ever know , ” said Mutuma Mathiu , a national journalist who calls the Kenyan media a key factor in public life .	-4.9496
“ If politicians are left to fend for themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy and return us back to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-5.2446
Kenya ’ s legislators have had public trouble in the past .	-7.4928
In May , they decided to reverse the cuts imposed by the National Remuneration Commission , and put their defusing salaries of around 532,000 schillings into effect every month – among the world ’ s highest .	-7.2842
Bad-Dürrheim : A dream comes true for the FC .	-3.8715
In spite of the cold weather and the rain , the official opening ceremony for the artificial turf port was not lost in the importance for the city and the football club .	-6.2002
I think everyone wanted a more pleasant holiday last Saturday , but Peter didn 't want to play with it .	-5.8640
So all those who did not have an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason had a look .	-5.7629
This was done by the musicians who embraced the act , as did many speakers .	-6.1978
Nass was therefore also appointed Chairman of the FC , Albrecht Schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .	-5.4554
His thanks were mainly due to mayor Walter Klumpp , who was very committed to the implementation of the project , to the municipal council , to the companies involved and to the members of the association who took part .	-7.4904
Especially Lothar Held , Paul Weidenegger , Heiner Gail and Peter Graf .	-2.6362
The elderly pensioners laid 400 square metres of paving stones for the new paths .	-5.1796
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the state MP Karl Rombach .	-4.8796
Other words of greeting spoke for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier , district chairman of the South Bay Football Association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr-Bremse of the Planning Office , who announced a donation to the youth department of the club .	-6.0848
Mayor Klumpp pointed out that in spring and autumn , recurring weather-related influences were attributed to the original pitch so that it could not be played .	-10.2385
Already 15 years ago , the first thoughts were on how to solve the problem , when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinsee was thought .	-12.1544
Both were rejected again .	-2.6166
Six years ago , thought was given to setting up an artificial turf pitch , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .	-4.6467
Concrete plans were started two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht , pledged a cost contribution of € 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved funding of € 104 000 .	-7.1437
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to adopt the remaining EUR 356 000 on the total cost of EUR 560 000 , summarised Klumpp .	-4.1000
The construction of the 68 x 108 m artificial turf ground started on 4 June .	-5.7947
During the construction period lasting over three months , 3000 cubic metres of earth were removed , half of which was used to create a dirt bike route .	-6.2271

The Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its work this morning .	-3.2406
Among other things , there should be the issue of dual citizenship , where both sides have conflicting ideas .	-5.4053
The SPD wants to end the pressure for German-born immigrant children to choose one - the Union rejects a dual passport .	-4.5414
On the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda this Friday , the SPD supported its ‘ no ’ to a toll on cars requested by the CSU .	-5.7966
A vignette is a " flat road for multiple journeys and therefore ecologically counterproductive " , said Florian Pronold , the SPD negotiator for transport , in a letter to his group .	-6.6767
There was a threat of expulsion on country roads , which are already the main points of accident .	-7.6921
In addition , the introduction of tolls for all cars would only be a first step from the point of view of Pronolds .	-5.0420
" There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date , " he said .	-3.4481
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart : Die Singing Föhn auf der Open-air Stage .	-5.2486

Vienna Airport Turns Passenger Calls	-3.0671
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.1249
How this will no longer happen at Vienna Schwechat Airport .	-5.3952
A large part of the speaker ’ s noise is thus eliminated - the noise level is to be reduced significantly .	-8.4286
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere .	-2.5822
As Airport-spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport is following an international trend by stopping announcements concerning individuals .	-5.2717
For example , the airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from making noisy calls .	-4.6783
In the future , the absence of these announcements - on average , around 200 personal calls through the speakers sound on a day - should make things more quiet at the airport .	-8.5814
" Experience has also shown that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little while , at the same time , all other information on changing flights or departure times are also lost here a little , " says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-7.5174

Vegan nutrition requires herbal alternatives to eggs , milk and dairy products .	-1.5637
For example , pureed tofu with plant seeds is a quarantium .	-5.0368
The vegetarian society also calls it World vegan Day on 1 November .	-6.3263
The German Vegetarian Association proposes a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World vegan Day on 1 November :	-4.7201
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter , yoghurt can be replaced by soy yogurt .	-3.2572
Soya , oat , almond , or rice milk can be used instead of milk .	-3.1927
Striking plant seeds replace traditional tap seeds .	-5.5083
There are also vegetable alternatives to eggs .	-1.7104
Half crushed ripe banana , for example , can replace an egg as a binder in a cake .	-2.7888
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linen plus three tablespoons of water are suitable .	-5.9651
For example , a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder , a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water are loosened .	-9.2625
But even 50 grams of soya yogurt or silk tofu can serve this purpose .	-4.4454
According to the Vebu , around 800 000 people in Germany currently feed vegan , i.e. purely vegetable . or .	-9.1783
Sleep in New York	-1.8887
On their way to their host families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , the students of the Black Forest grammar school met the American city of New York .	-4.2449
After eight hours of flight , the Brooklyn Bridge was immediately accessible on foot to the heart of the city , Manhattan .	-4.7558
A fascinating view of the world famous skyline was already present here , which is a special attraction in the evening .	-6.3436
The time difference meant that the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours , but the day at Times Square was decided according to the motto , " The City does not sleep " .	-10.4881
In spite of Shutdown , the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and reached on foot .	-4.9363
Then the financial center was about Wall Street to commemorate September 11 .	-5.7333
On the third day , students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city from the 373 meter high viewing platform of Empire Building , enjoying the view .	-5.8364
After that , the excitement of New York streets over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun .	-6.2316
After a short flight from New York to Boston , the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School .	-4.3737
This year again , a Hubertusmesse will be celebrated on the name-day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstra<unk>e .	-6.2278
According to legend , St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège .	-4.5449
The Jagdhorn group of the Jagdhreiter Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth music on Parforcehörnen ( natural horns in the mood Es ) according to old , originally French melodies .	-6.6716
The brass players wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders , horses and dog mutes on hunting .	-7.2752
The festive fair will take place on Sunday , November 3 , at 11.30 a.m.	-8.0134
The new design of the Opschlag shines with a new café .	-5.2852
One that invites you to stay and return .	-3.4950
One that wants to make the name a program .	-3.2390
A Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that , according to the lexicon , expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation .	-5.8844
In the case of visiting the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight of the University of Rhine-Waal , it must not remain the pure sense of déjà vu .	-5.7745
After all , the coffee shop with its beautiful name has exactly that aim : to make a real stay not only mental , but also a regular experience .	-9.5002
Because it 's fun and simply beautiful .	-3.0615
A glance into the inner workings of the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away .	-4.3974
The ultra-modern but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good .	-3.7729
The team , together with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top , pampers the guest with a variety of coffee and cocktail options .	-5.3678
There are delicious cakes or individually selected fresh baguettes .	-4.6558
The owners , both 33 years old , made a name for themselves before the opening of the pretty café at the Opschlag as a restaurateur : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-6.3615
The likeable café lovers hope to see more audience from moving to Kleve .	-5.4436
Not least through the university .	-2.9583
" Where we do not have a specific target group , " says Daniel Büttner .	-3.6131
Instead , the two students here would like to address just as much as seniors and all age groups in between .	-5.4966
Speaking of café lovers .	-1.7174
The friendly owner couple stands behind the coffee delight .	-2.3112
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in a variety of variations .	-4.9539
Expressofan	-0.4327
Daniel Büttner is the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino .	-3.3908
" To do this a baguette - that 's my thing " , she tells the NRZ .	-5.5750
Two events already took place in the bright café .	-3.1596
Let me say one thing .	-3.3175
After all , the port festival took place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-5.0949
But there was also the Ringelande .	-3.8274
" Nice , successful and funny " , the two 33-year olds found .	-4.3875
But it is not Jedermann 's business .	-3.4663
Perhaps that 's why Daniel Büttner is not a keen fan of event evenings : " You can 't make everyone right " .	-6.0585
And with an event I speak only those who are interested in the special event .	-4.6394
Therefore events will be the exception for us .	-3.8323
" We want to interfere with normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.8508
In other words , Déjà Vu also stands for reliability .	-3.2660
In terms of the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve .	-4.3897
The road is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile .	-4.6908
To the delight of many Klever , the guests from near and far and the students , who discover the gastronomic areas and thus also the Café Déjà Vu .	-6.4538

A Day of Thank You for the MGV in Dinker	-4.4379
It was the 165 foundation festival that the MGV " Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker " had invited this year and 52 guests , active singers and their wives , were happy to come .	-6.5544
In the restaurant " Witteborg " in Dinker , all enjoyed the harmonious cooperation with the music .	-5.6150

The UN ’ s New Poverty Reduction Goals	-4.4601
The United Nations is starting to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals , announced 12 years ago , for combating poverty .	-4.8654
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals .	-3.8310
They have been included in the final draft of the document which will be adopted at the summit by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard .	-6.0109
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit tonight that the time has come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-7.1865
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process aimed at agreeing universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.8287
“ These goals will build on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework .	-2.8904
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by the member states to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals , which are based on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-6.3995
Although the SG Achim / Baden hasn ´ t won the last four days of the match , the handball league still has a good mood .	-6.2714
Trainer Tomasz Malmon makes no doubt about this .	-3.3153
All remain fully motivated .	-2.6780
Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .	-3.7942
" After all , I don 't know how a victory tastes " , Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-5.5961
Even though the third-party reserve from Fredenbeck has not cleared trees , Malmon is warning against pointing .	-6.3863
I have trained many players myself in A-Youth .	-4.8626
That is why they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-3.8454
" It is also important to wait and see if there is any reinforcement from the first , " explains the SG coach .	-5.8379
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances .	-5.4226
Above all , the cover work and the switchover did not last .	-6.7992
Recycling opportunities must also definitely improve .	-3.3821
So I hope my players have finally got their heads free during the short break .	-4.2992
Mozambique ’ s security concerns are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-2.9917
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Mapcars under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique , to make peace calls on a rare public demonstration .	-5.5585
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.2407
For fear of the future of the country , she turned her business clothes into Portuguese for a T-shirt marked “ We demand security ” and joined the crowd in the capital ’ s Independence Square on Thursday .	-6.5816
For two weeks , there have been reports almost daily of clashes between government forces and Renamo , one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .	-3.8871
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by whites ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country 's independent government .	-8.6248
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.9999
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to fall back into a full-blown conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.6432
The stakes for the rapidly growing economy are high , because the discovery of vast offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in over $ 50 billion in investment in the next few years from firms like Rio Tinto , Vale of Brazil , Eni of Italy , and Anavarko from the US .	-6.9228
The ruling Frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo blame each other for the tensions .	-2.1388
Renamo claimed that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional stronghold of Renamos on 17 October .	-3.5201
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo-bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group ’ s leader , Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times .	-4.4577
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.7166
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.1755
AFP , the French news agency , said Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a “ loser , ” who wants to use “ all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.8806
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-2.7795
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was giving up the 1992 peace agreement .	-4.4139
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement .	-2.9359
“ Our vision is to reopen negotiations seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-2.8787
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.6481
“ We have here two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who are meeting heads together , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-4.6506
None of them is good at negotiating , and none is willing to make the necessary concessions .	-2.9459
Renamo , who is pressing for electoral reforms , has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November .	-3.1308
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.2691
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.6646
Renamos ’ s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , the Movimento Democratico de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , founded by a former Renamo-member , is likely to improve in the elections .	-4.8637
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.8833
" He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , " said Mazanga .	-3.2969
It is not clear what capacity Renamo has , but it has launched disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link .	-6.1662
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala , which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port used by mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-5.3447
In June , Rio stopped using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-4.4131
Mazanga answered cautiously whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-4.1625
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.1882
Instability has increased frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent wave of abduction .	-4.1555
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.6660
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said the people simply wanted stability .	-2.7584
“ There is no interest in Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-4.2535
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ role models for life , ” says one author .	-3.0366
The stories of Thor showed that “ brute force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Arthur legend demonstrated how important it is to have a dream .	-4.1370
But many of the myths were “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland called for a “ careful selection ” of age-appropriate works .	-4.7341
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.4299
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.4229
He added that authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” would “ shut down ” children completely , because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ sublimated ” .	-5.5767
Crossley Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglican language and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as possible . ”	-5.2393
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope .	-2.6648
Not everything must be simplified or lead to happy ends , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.9045
This must be a subliminal presentation , through which history is revealed and not explained .	-4.5473
This is the old story of showing instead of telling .	-2.1371
Hansjakob is moving again in Freihof	-4.7420
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob acquired his retirement pension in Haslach , and on Sunday his last years were brought to life in the " Freihof " .	-6.3237
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely short scene game .	-5.0136
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death , scriptwriter and Hansjakobactor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia .	-6.8610
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesman with the ten different scenes , explained connections and bridged intervals from youth to the approaching retirement .	-5.2278
On 22 October 1913 Hansjakob comes home in his children ’ s sky , in his Freihof .	-4.9981
And then the scene began , in which Alois Krafczyk once again appeared in his role as the great son of the city .	-5.4480
He performed in style with Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach 's two-chipping and " Black Forest Füchsen " .	-5.8520
He was received not only by the audience with a lot of applause , but also by his sister Philippine .	-7.3059
Billy Sum-Hermann was incredibly well versed in the role of his sister and gave her immense life in mimics and gestures .	-5.9696
Between the scenes the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played selected pieces of music and rounded off the performance .	-5.6054
Haslach 's mayor , Heinz Winkler , was awarded the honour of awarding honorary citizens , who , together with a part of the town council , held a ceremony in representation of the then incumbent , Hättich .	-10.3563
The three royal singer , Hansjakob , then went on to say : " Oh how beautiful , there are again youth memories of my own reign " .	-10.3778
With their song " O Jesus " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the storytellers with their loud " Aus , Aus " .	-4.6125
At that time , Hansjakub expressed his criticism of the Amtskirche in the same way as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .	-6.1471
He found his resting place in the Heimaterde , behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten .	-8.3504
" A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had passed away forever , " it said at the end of the scene .	-5.2483
There were plenty of applause and praise from the audience for the performance .	-3.6953
Basketball : The Neckar Giant ’ s Hope Grows	-2.9735
The chances for the Ligaverbleg of the sport-run Ludwigsburger Bundesliga Basketball League have increased .	-8.0788
If there is a wildcard procedure , then there is less competition for the Neckar Giants .	-4.7201
The basketball project Hamburg Towers does not apply for a post office .	-3.9248
" We will not participate in the wildcard process , " said former national player Pascal Roller , who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012 .	-3.9519
However , a first breath of fresh air could not be heard from Ludwigsburg .	-5.5445
" We didn 't deal with the wildcard procedure until it was clear that Düsseldorf did not get a license , " said Neckar-Giant 's boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-6.3821
Until May 23 , newcomer Düsseldorf Basket will be able to submit documents to the Court of Arbitration and prove its Federal Economic soundness .	-7.7936
Until now , however , the licence has been refused twice to the Rhineland countries .	-4.2802
The arbitration court is the last instance .	-2.1963
Haigerloch : Evening meal is coming to the fore .	-4.8317
As a contribution of the city to the 150-year-old presence of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch , the cultural and tourism office of the city dedicates the last of its public themed tours on Sunday , 27 October , the evening meal church .	-6.6080
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum , Haigerloch was to be considered after 1850 , when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule .	-4.1180
The crowning final point is a visit to the evening church .	-3.9238
There the leaders will tell the story of the building of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area .	-6.5665
Last but not least , there is a view of the evening painting , created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbstriter .	-5.8013
It is an orginally faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese image of Leonardo da Vinci .	-3.3136
Meeting point for the one and a half hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller Museum .	-3.5258
Tickets are available at the box office of the Atomkellermuseum .	-3.3168

Snowden Could testify in Russia	-2.3901
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US scouts in his Russian asylum .	-4.0553
Representatives of the Federal Generalstaatanwaltschaft could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30 year olds in person in Russia .	-6.5230
This was notified by the Interfax agency on the basis of unknown circles who were familiar with the situation .	-6.0678
It was said that such an issue could be resolved by the intergovernmental authorities .	-5.3900
It is virtually impossible for Snowden to leave Russia .	-3.8705
" In this case he loses his refugee status " , the agency quoted its source .	-2.7506
Because Germany was an ally of the US , Snowden threatened extradition there , it continued to say .	-4.2744
Slow Breath Pay Up	-3.5364

After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta , the tournament went into the decisive phase .	-3.2516
The favourites Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner were in the same position with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic ( both teams of SG Rohrweiler ) , so the last two matches had to make the decision .	-5.9753
At the award ceremony Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the Hiking Cup to Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner , who had the longest breath on the finish straight .	-4.6108
Second place was the double Michael Klippel / Sadmin Osmicic .	-3.2186

Speed and coordination are needed here .	-1.8993
For all little detectives , the open-air museum offers a mystery tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday at 12 and 14 o ’ clock .	-5.4550
On a round trip the children must guess which stories are true or lie .	-4.8078

Burt is not able to escape from his dream despite a heart failure .	-4.7464
With his savings , a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed , he transfers to Los Angeles by ship .	-4.7003

Wrote Piepsen Disrupts Residents	-4.3991
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land .	-1.6063
They distribute the coal coming from ships to the pile .	-3.7406
The company also has several iron in the fire at its site .	-6.1567
In addition to coal imports , Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind plant logistics .	-3.8281
Black charcoal shimmers on the storage site in front of the dike .	-3.8718
There are two massive blue bulkhead and rear loaders that can be distributed or loaded as needed .	-8.1594
With every movement of the handling devices a loud warning noise sounds across the site .	-6.7497
" The signals serve security and are legally required " , says Matthias Schrell , CEO of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .	-3.6649
With an unfavourable wind this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have been some complaints from people from the city north .	-7.0823
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the people affected , says the 40-year-old .	-5.2982
In close consultation with the authorities , the warning signals should now be kept quieter by means of technical measures .	-7.5952
In the future , it will continue to rely on open dialogue with its neighbours .	-3.7011
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site .	-4.1212
With the extension of the Niedersachsenbrücke , Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector .	-4.4300
Thanks to the 18,5 meter deep tub in front of the terminal , capesize-bulk carriers can be prepared here .	-7.2412
" This year we want to break the 3-million dollar mark in the envelope " , Schrell said .	-5.1753
In addition to the Eon power plant on site , the imported coal goes to power stations in the inland .	-5.8510

The price of oil continued to decline on Friday , after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing .	-4.2193
The reference crude for supplies in December had fallen by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel in electronic trading in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange in late morning .	-5.1133
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday , which meant a decline of 5.8 % in October .	-3.0670

Over the course of five weeks , supply had increased by 25 million barrels .	-3.3593
But on Friday , there was evidence of increased demand from two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing .	-3.8781

Court blocked Decision on the Stop and Frisk Policy of the NYPD	-4.4797
On Thursday , a federal court in the US blocked the order of a judge calling for changes to the New York Police Department ’ s Stop and Search program , and expelled the judge from the case .	-5.9509
The 2nd US Supreme Court declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision was made on the appeal of the city .	-5.4366
In August , the judge ruled that the city was violating the constitution with the way in which the program for holding and holding people was implemented .	-6.0776
The city appealed against its assessment and the proposed remedies , including the decision to establish a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and training program .	-5.1231
On Tuesday , the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the required suspension .	-3.6580
The appeal report stated that the judge must be relieved of the case , because it violated the code of conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which it publicly responded to the Court ’ s criticism .	-6.2330
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-hair programme .	-5.0146
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot programme of cameras with body-borne cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out .	-5.9476
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were made redundant after police checks .	-6.2388
An oral trial of the city ’ s vocation is planned after March 14 , 2014 .	-3.9419
The stop-and-go tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders .	-3.6074
Such checks have been carried out in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded checks during the term of the non-partisan mayor , Michael Bloomberg , rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of which were black and Latin American men .	-5.6697
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities filed a lawsuit that became a collective action .	-4.4136
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop-and-hair program say that the changes will put an end to unfair practices , create a more credible and effective police force , and influence the way other police presidents use the regime .	-5.5937
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police , but not crime ; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that has been under pressure since thousands of posts disappeared over the last decade .	-6.4746
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-hair practice that was constitutional , but merely reform the way in which the NYPD implemented controls .	-5.1220

Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning to work as a consultant in the club , according to Henne .	-5.8430
In 2008 , the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn established a hospital in Socogim , a shantytown on the outskirts of the capital , in record time of almost a week .	-10.6804
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott .	-2.2913
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalised away .	-3.8963
One learns a lot in Africa as a doctor , according to Henne , for example deceleration against burn-out .	-4.8421
Due to the political unrest in the country , it was not possible to do as many journeys as planned , but many doctors came to Germany to hospitalize in various areas .	-5.6261

Coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip .	-2.7073
Former News of the Word editor , Andy Coulson , allegedly used “ phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about what then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke did .	-5.7358
Public Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey , News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.2147
The newspaper ordered the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemail , and pursued it , but Coulson also called her and left messages as the court learned .	-5.0779
“ In the opinion of the public prosecutor , Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , is no one who stands in front of people ’ s homes and hopes to catch them fresh , but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction , ” Edis explained .	-6.5450
He said NotW uses three procedures to research stories investigative : telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-2.8595
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.3908
Obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .	-3.6536
What about the first ?	-1.3370
Does he know about phone hacking ?	-2.2946
He denies that , but we say , “ And if he knew it . ”	-3.5587
Rumors about a Clarke affair were first picked up by NotW ’ s feature editor , who was a source of sexual interest in Pawlby , said : “ Do not waste your time , it is with Charles . ”	-6.2439
A band with voicemail from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire ’ s home .	-3.6602
The investigators also found entries on the detective 's computer where Pawlby and her sister were saved as " projects " .	-3.2166
In the time the searches were running , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.1716
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Pawlby ’ s movements .	-2.4071
On June 18 , 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , about which I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-3.5328
Edis stated that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as those of other important personalities , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-5.6901
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman for an affair when he himself was liated with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at the time .	-5.7593
Coulson and Brooks argue that they had conspired with others to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-5.3491
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted telephone hacking .	-2.7161

President Fran<unk>ois Hollande , while receiving club and association representatives at the <unk>lysée Palace in Paris on Thursday , also listened to their complaints .	-4.2210
But he refused to spare football from the planned € 75 % levy on income of more than € 1 million per year , which all firms in the country will pay for two years from 2014 .	-5.9212
The other side also remained tough .	-2.9762

Hosted : No absolute protection possible	-5.1711
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage " , Mayor Jens Häu<unk>ler opened the Civil Information Event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-5.0032
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and present ideas .	-5.0963
More senior officials made it clear : " The final decisions are made by members of the local council " .	-6.0161
The flooding that Gechingen hit unprepared on 15 May 2009 was a serious event that raised the question of protective measures for the future , so chieftains .	-10.5342
A river basin study was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aida , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-4.4612
" The protection of as many cultivated plots as possible is the goal " , says Häu<unk>ler .	-4.0748
The planning of the protection against floods which are expected every 100 years according to the German weather service has been arranged .	-7.3043
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .	-2.4948
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100a Klima " .	-4.2329
The water masses , which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 , corresponded to an annual flood .	-5.1080
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , " says Häu<unk>ler .	-3.3151
In order to achieve the protection of the HQ 100a climate , approximately EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the local community estimated to be around 70 percent .	-8.7492
More often , however , pointed out that support only exists if an overall concept is implemented .	-4.9071
To this end , the community needs the participation of its citizens .	-4.5263
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.7526
At best , implementation can begin in 2016 .	-2.2822
Among other things , the protection concept , which was presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the stem valley .	-6.2458
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns .	-3.0957
Among other things , it has been called into question why no more dams and reservoirs are planned to protect the place .	-5.9795
Gregor Kühn , specialist for the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hülsheim , which presented the concept , stressed that it requires the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-7.4102
In addition , it is considered to be the most economical solution , according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe .	-4.0861
There was widespread resentment among residents of the old town who , even in normal thunderstorms , often suffer from overloading of the channel network .	-8.9851
The problem is well known in the administration and first measures have already been taken .	-4.0724
More often , however , pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed .	-6.5838
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way as to cope with the regeneration events lasting two to three years .	-6.0325

In the early Friday afternoon , two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision at Landstra<unk>e 44 near Revensdorf .	-5.9051
The police immediately closed the road completely , but could not say much about the accident .	-7.2783
However , there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated .	-3.4307
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai .	-4.9463
Both vehicles crashed together , with the woman so severely trapped that the fire brigade needed almost half an hour to get them out of the vehicle .	-6.2469

Dick had experience of God , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .	-3.6039
Perhaps he was crazy , had taken drugs to his brain .	-3.8343

James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted again in September that the US did not use foreign espionage “ to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms to expand its international competitiveness or profits . ”	-10.9933
But since Edward Snowden , the former whistle-blower , began publishing his cornucopia to US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that they can take the director ’ s word .	-5.4372
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied Brazil ’ s oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud-providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought the company paranoia to a new record for state surveillance .	-5.7162

In Germany , many of these companies are the global market leaders in their respective niche markets .	-3.3003
“ Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access , ” the BVT warns in a report .	-3.3561

In the front , the often reprinted and embroidered clothes are closed , often with a veil , but at the back they go down their backs and often end up in a tug .	-11.0398
But the spirits differ , as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Klettmüller .	-5.3908
In men the suit with waistcoat and Plastron dominates , but also cream-coloured or brown combinations can be chosen .	-5.4062

The parents of the teenager , whose body was found in a gathered ring debate in the gym of his High School , are convinced that her son was murdered , explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday .	-5.8589
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the state of Georgia was found on 11 January in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the school tournament hall .	-5.4851
Sheriff ’ s investigation officers in Lownnden County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but this questioned the 17-year-old family .	-5.8678
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” said Benjamin Crump , Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson ’ s lawyer , to FoxNews.com.	-3.6940
They would never have believed he had died as the Sheriff concluded .	-2.8727
" They believe that there is no logic to violate both the laws of physics and common sense , " says Crump .	-4.1960
Rather , they are convinced that the truth is covered up in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .	-4.2214
“ Her son went to school to learn and came back in the piggy bag , ” he commented .	-5.0917
US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death , because a number of important issues remain unresolved .	-3.8940
What was the cause of death ?	-0.7112
Is his death due to a crime ?	-1.6148
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.6122
I follow the facts in which direction they lead .	-3.0534
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.6619
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-7.2952
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsies indicate that Johnson had died of the consequences of a “ position-driven suffocation . ”	-5.8760
A second autopsy , however , produced a different cause of death , Moore said .	-5.6492
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-2.2527
Moore added , if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation to Johnson ’ s death , he will instruct the FBI to carry out the investigation .	-3.9644

CDC Publish Allergic Directives for Schools	-2.4178
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a set of guidelines for the treatment of children ’ s food allergies in schools .	-3.4754
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government , as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases .	-3.9428
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-2.4616
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-3.0216
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies at the educational body and staff , and how to deal with children with allergic reactions .	-5.3851
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin in stock – the EpiPen auto-injection is most often used – to deal with a potentially lethal hypersensitivity reaction .	-4.5806
State legislators have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to keep Epinephrin in in stock .	-4.5598
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction .	-2.9194
Children may say , “ It feels like something presses on my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels like a hair lying on it ” or “ My tongue tickles ” .	-4.0773
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ sex indeterminate ”	-3.8968
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with non-specific genitals .	-3.0649
Newborn babies are no longer fixed male or female .	-3.1417
Under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can specify “ indeterminate ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .	-4.5664
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions regarding operations for a sexual assignment in newborn children and to combat discrimination against intersex people .	-6.2177
According to the BBC , an intersexual person said , “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.5219
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars .	-3.2097
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year is not born either as a boy or as a girl .	-3.8897
They belong to the intersex , a group that comes under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( ovaries or testicles ) , or unusually developed genitals .	-5.7969
Wallis Simpson was perhaps intersexually .	-1.9252
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US suggest that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible , rather than waiting for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding – if at all – on an operation .	-6.7983
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the problem of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-7.3209
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.6634
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery , but most children do not , ” he said .	-3.4561
You can do a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop .	-4.5636
The scientific data on how a child develops its sexual identity is not very accurate .	-2.9459
Nobody knows why it is happening   .	-2.6757
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.8409
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersex people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people , because their status is not gender , but is determined by their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one .	-5.8310
These characteristics were seen in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair loss , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or in chromosomal structures and hormones .	-6.2821
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in working life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .	-4.4513
Young people who do not share the gender picture now have a special camp .	-3.4621
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate male , female or “ third gender ” on official documents .	-3.5272
In June , Australians Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ gender-free ” person , after a court had granted lifetime retention of a “ unspecified ” gender status .	-4.8344
In addition to M and W , German cards will have a third allocation , X for intersexual , according to the Ministry of the Interior .	-4.9123
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news report on France 24 .	-3.8928
In 2011 , dozens of French MPs in the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-7.5008
The US website , Catholic Online , has also spoken out against German law on the grounds that , “ If the world is dragged into a new state , where sex is a choice , but sexual activity is not , then we are twisting two more pillars of civilisation . ”	-6.2988
The mother of a Maryland newborns explained to Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were given a gender at birth .	-5.3773
“ Parental status is already stressful enough , even without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your child , ” she said to the parents website .	-6.1537
Children need stability and security .	-0.6777
Historically , children born with both male and female gender were called hermaphrodites , after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .	-4.4518
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that could be erased and then rebuilt .	-3.8105
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , now that it is known how complex gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they assign .	-6.3187
“ In the middle of the 20th century one was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-3.8273
When such a child was born , one called not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-2.8439
The prevailing theory about treating children with non-specific genitals is based on John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who argued that gender is malleable .	-5.7368
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental stimuli – as parents raise a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , and shaped whether a person considers himself male or female .	-4.1161
But his theories became controversial in a case known as “ John / Joan . ”	-3.2652
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a botched circumcision to castrate the child and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl .	-5.9542
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , which it was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.4647
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male gender and married a woman .	-3.1115
With 38 , he committed suicide .	-2.8407
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.3002
But , in the 1990 ’ s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of these sexual operations came to the public , who “ are not happy with the outcome . ”	-4.0967
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-3.7594
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man .	-4.1017
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 , and he was raised as a girl .	-3.9034
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.9939
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he told ABCNews.com .	-2.3309
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.9392
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal load .	-3.5521
But , because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical files .	-3.2618
What he found out was shocking .	-1.2632
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me .	-3.4703
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals .	-2.8825
After experiencing the truth , he moved back to the male identity , received testosterone injections , and removed his breasts .	-4.0805
The operation has made it infertile .	-3.2757
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-4.3761
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , director of California ’ s Advocates for Informed Choice , worries that German law can “ stamp and encourage stigmatization . ”	-4.5465
“ Many activists are concerned that Germany ’ s decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to “ not assign ” the child , ” she explained .	-8.6805
We fear that this will favour intervention .	-2.7853
We think it would be better to assign gender to men or women and then wait .	-3.6955
But we do not yet know how the law will impact , so we can only speculate .	-2.9120
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as a third sex . ”	-3.8891
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.3567
The German law concerns the allocation at birth .	-8.5363
This is not a fight to which small children should be forced at this time .	-3.6797
When they grow up , they can choose their own body .	-3.1004
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a Pittsburgh chest radiologist , who has a daughter with a sexual difference disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the German law “ allows ” both parents and children .	-5.5823
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance .	-2.8561
Due to the receptor defect of target cells for testosterone , Katie developed female characteristics .	-3.1277
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-2.0469
Today , Katie is 29 and married , working at the University of Pennsylvania as a member of the Child Psychiatry .	-4.5319
Although she is infertile , she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-4.0186
“ The law gives room to parents , so they do not have to take decisions hastily , ” said Baratz .	-4.6192
It gives them the time to do various tests and to clarify things , giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female ” .	-4.5668
In this way everything is fine – you raise the child and you love it .	-6.2985
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy parental leave .	-3.6572
And you don ’ t have to rush an operation that cannot be undone .	-4.6546
“ This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents because they believe they are not doing the right thing , ” she explained .	-4.7638
Ultimately , the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that is wonderful .	-3.8807
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-2.5439
Unknowns Inflate Girls by Auto Shot	-4.0555
When shooting from a car , strangers injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt .	-4.2957
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening .	-4.7446
The police informed this in castle .	-4.4177
The girl was slightly injured on the left calf .	-2.0537
Rescue workers took the girl to hospital .	-3.0802
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-3.9927
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-0.7181
The perpetrators also fired on a bus stop .	-2.8519
A slice of bread was broken .	-4.6143
Then they drove away .	-2.7495
The criminal police are investigating , it was said on Friday .	-3.9569
To date , the police inspectorate , Kempten , has a quiet Halloween night .	-4.5495
The officials were called only twice to brood children who threw them against house facades .	-5.9469
As the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the remains of the eggs immediately , no material damage should have occurred .	-6.8677
There are also a number of New Year 's oily plants in the city , but no material damage has been caused here either .	-9.8057
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorferfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his wheel hiding was stolen .	-6.6201
Until the police arrived , however , the man found all his bicycle hiding in the immediate vicinity , so the police did not have to take any further action .	-7.9683
Living with the Future	-2.0526
In fact , Waltraud Ries lives fantastically .	-3.0698
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , old trees , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.5543
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-3.4497
" You hopefully have no fear of spiders ? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame .	-4.0806
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time now .	-3.0872
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-2.1930
However , the reason is not spinning-phobia , but the concern to be unable to cope with the many steps to the house and the apartment at age , she explains .	-7.4999
In addition , since a Meniscus operation , the mid-fifties have experienced what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap .	-5.6808
She recently published a book on ' Lucky Stay at Age - Which apartment is the best for me ? ' .	-6.2046
" Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at all in old age , " she begins to tell .	-5.1113
When she moved with her husband to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of green .	-6.4442
Today at the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently .	-3.3054
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who actually deal with the subject of ' living at age ' .	-5.5405
Most people crowd it out as long as it goes .	-4.1309
Old are always just the other ' , she says smiling .	-4.5172
It is only when the suffering pressure is really great that one gets thought .	-5.0719
" Then it can be too late , " says Ries .	-3.9836
In her book , interior designers present 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age .	-4.6215
She explains , " What type of housing you choose is always an individual choice " .	-5.9607
D i e solution there is not for age .	-2.3436
Even those who can afford the retirement status in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also become ill .	-5.7438
And : ' Without a good knowledge of the language of the country you will also be able to communicate in Dolce Vita , ' the specialist book authors will give you a chance to consider people who want to move .	-11.3613
Among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of living , or the often cited pensionable WG .	-7.0296
At age , everyone has his ticks and maces .	-4.4052
" For me , such a community would be nothing , " she says with a wink .	-4.5967
Not at all like a student ´ s house with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .    .	-6.5034
" At age one simply needs its retreat rooms , " says Ries .	-5.2966
However , the book author does not wish to rule out the possibility of a senior citizens ’ housing community functioning .	-5.5554
However , this has to be different from the classic student WG .	-6.0399
And sometimes you just want your peace , ' she believes .	-4.1007
With this opinion , at least in the state capital , it is not alone .	-4.3283
" Most of the old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it goes " , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the civic service life at the age of the state capital .	-6.0425
Your department is advising people on ' getting older ' .	-4.3454
For this reason , older people in particular would often also accept inconvenience and restrictions , only to stay in their usual environment , that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest .	-7.2021
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment accessible .	-4.3319
Ries recommends that all those who deal with the age-appropriate renovation of their house or apartment should first get detailed information and not commission the first best craftsman .	-9.2900
Today there are also specialists for the adaptation according to age .	-5.3454
Even in the rental apartment this can be realized , and if it is only the bathroom seat increase , interior designers clarify .	-6.9791
But it is not always possible to change the existing apartment according to age and thus without barriers , even though it is still so beautiful .	-5.7909
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries .	-2.2996
The room was very small and the bathroom was very small .	-8.1981
She will continue her search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-2.7454
Before moving , it greys her more than before the spider on her home door .	-4.7082
The US wants to prosecute Snowden	-5.1920
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-2.4063
He is also accused of having passed on confidential information illegally .	-5.1696
As a result , he had to face criminal proceedings in the US , said US State Department spokesman Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-4.9732
The recent statements made by Snowden would not change that either .	-3.9559
Previously , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him further .	-4.4442
Psaki stressed that the speeches were made by a parliamentarian rather than by a German member of the government .	-6.5214
Edward Snowden , the secret service provider , is generally willing to talk to German authorities .	-4.0084
First , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.9470
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday , after a meeting with Snowden , and forwarded to the Federal Government , the Bundestag , and the Federal Attorney General .	-6.4679
The letter has the following text after a translation  :	-4.0492
To those responsible	-2.7508
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .	-3.0200
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden , who used to be contractual or through a direct position as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .	-4.8022
In the course of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government , which caused me to act out of a moral obligation .	-6.4063
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was exposed to a serious and persistent hoard that forced me to leave my family and home .	-4.8060
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.5446
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.7051
Citizens around the world , as well as senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of blanket surveillance that is accountable to no one as a public service .	-5.1712
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust .	-4.2123
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while the risks involved have been visibly reduced .	-4.7561
Although the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a gutter and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression .	-5.4736
Yet telling the truth is not a crime .	-2.3201
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this damaging stance .	-3.8195
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible investigation of the issues relating to the statements made in the media , particularly in terms of the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.6469
I look forward to meeting you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all .	-4.2529

Kindergarten has found a private buyer .	-1.7849
" The building is in good hands , " says Winterlings Mayor Michael Maier .	-2.6605
The community sold the former kindergarten in the Garden Road to a private individual .	-4.5308
The local council approved the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public sector .	-4.2283
The building changed its owner at a " reasonable " price .	-2.4777
" The community is satisfied , " says Maier .	-3.1367

Report : Obama ’ s campaign considering replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-4.1556
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton , according to the New York Times .	-3.6519
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-3.3979
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , and she reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had conducted “ extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 , ” to see if Obama ’ s declining hope of re-election looks better if he dropped bidders .	-6.7428
According to Jonathan Martin , the National Policy correspondent for the Times , the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading campaign staff and White House officials , notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the impact on the poll values of replacing former Secretary of State Clinton with the Vice-President .	-6.6594
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-1.9625
Only a half-dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former White House senior adviser , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change .	-3.0373
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley has led the effort to exchange Biden , despite her “ close , personal relationship , ” before finally choosing such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-6.3555
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.5226
“ I said a lot of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” Daley told the magazine .	-3.7023
It must be remembered that the President had terrible poll values at the time , so we thought , “ For God ’ s will , what are we doing ? ”	-4.5929
While Daley called the investigation “ due diligence , ” Martin told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that during the re-election campaign , there was considerable effort to find out whether such a move was paying out in terms of the ballot box .	-5.9092
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think about anything seriously , ” Martin explained on AC360 .	-4.8113
But it is not clear whether Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange .	-2.6831
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about the potential change .	-2.8188
While Daley stated that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew .	-4.1741
Martin added that “ double down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political probes had reached Obama ’ s desk .	-3.9043
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama knew nothing about the investigation of whether to let Biden fall in the elections .	-4.7908
“ Possibly ” , Martin replied .	-2.4837
What happens on the move with my email ?	-2.5683
Email actually means electronic mail .	-3.3635
Did the concept of the Internet service , like the traditional postal service , technically implement the confidentiality of correspondence ?	-7.3176
When designing early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-3.3768
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not been taken care to create a solid foundation for a secure correspondence .	-6.5739
Therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-4.1512
If " Anna " user sends a mail to " Benni " , are the computers of the two connected ?	-3.9668
Anna 's email program or browser sends the mail to her service provider 's mail server in the first step .	-3.9071
For example , if it has a GMail account , it would be Google .	-2.3323
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses .	-1.9668
On the route the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet .	-4.9756
Bennie can then call the content from his provider .	-3.3801
Are traditional e-mails being read along their way through the net ?	-4.4660
Most mails are read by software robots on the way .	-3.5503
The sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment .	-3.8662
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems .	-2.5733
In addition , providers check whether this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted out into a spam folder .	-5.4534
Do the robots have another task ?	-2.5192
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.1688
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holidays , Google can link to holiday offers .	-4.5207
Do unknown people also read the emails ?	-3.2196
The probability of unauthorized persons reading a message is very low .	-4.7118
In theory , however , this is possible .	-2.2841
In companies , administrators often have the ability to read electronic mail .	-4.2308
The law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails .	-5.2564
This includes possible illegal spying actions .	-4.2639
Is it possible to protect e-mail from being read ?	-3.3470
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an email can be effectively encrypted against co-reading .	-4.2782
It is also possible , with great technical effort , to conceal the metadata of an email communication , so that it is not even easy to identify who has communicated with whom .	-6.9657
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.8015
According to a study by Convios Consulting in August 2013 , Yahoo and Google play a minor role in the mainly privately used post compartments .	-9.0703
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had last fallen , Gmail significantly increased .	-3.7673
Assured Mother in the Forest and Retirement	-4.2488
When his praying mother died , a Wolfsburg man forged a plan .	-3.6092
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance .	-4.6319
In order to continue to receive pension and care allowance , a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigation in the forest .	-5.5134
He first covered up the death of the 89-year-old , and then spent more than a year and a half of his money .	-5.1035
Now the 67 year-old has to answer for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-3.0990
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.1947
The man was suspected as early as May : at that time , it was apparent that no medication was needed for the mother in need of care .	-5.5866
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-3.2084
Because the officials found this strange , they continued to identify .	-4.9553
It came out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for it .	-6.3233
The 67 year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.2496
A charge , according to the police , showed no evidence of a capital crime .	-6.3787
Fancy ice cream shining in the dark ?	-3.4068
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice shining in the dark , using jellies .	-4.2714
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous delicacy .	-5.4748
The idea came after reading research on jellies and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the bright protein .	-5.5435
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue , raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow .	-7.6822
Chris explains that the ice cream responds to the heat in the mouth and light – so the more you leak , the lighter it becomes .	-4.2573
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious , ” says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for <unk> 200 . ”	-5.1537
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.8995
When the mouth warms up the protein , the pH increases and the ice lights up .	-3.1542
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it onto the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-5.1146
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced , because the jelly glow material is four times more expensive than gold .	-4.0618
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-2.1369
But it tastes delicious .	-2.1494
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-3.3247
But his latest creation is to be more ambitious .	-2.7787
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.3029
This is , in itself , impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make ice cream ; but I suspect we find a way to do it .	-5.7944
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-2.8735
The TSV Morsum is still at the Handball Association after six days of play .	-4.1140
It is now time for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to take the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-10.7868
The season starts with this game for us .	-3.0975
" I hope that we will finally have our heads free " , Ehlers is cautiously optimistic .	-5.2668
At last , with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme , he has his entire crew at his disposal .	-5.4061
Daverden also relies on speed game as we do .	-5.8989
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.3180
But first and foremost , we need to increase our coverage , which , at the last moment , has left anything but a certain impression .	-7.1711
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first victory against Nordhorn .	-5.1487
The game was of course a house number .	-2.2100
But for that reason we are not the favourite , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-6.5306
However , Panitz now wants to post in Morsum to start a series .	-4.7531
absence becomes Jan-Malte Jodat .	-2.8595
For this reason , the A-teenager Joost Wind<unk> , who is active with double playability at the A-Youth-Bundesliga Bundesliga , celebrates his season debut .	-7.8378
If you 're not hot in such a game , stay at home .	-6.2253
Halloween 2013 : In figures	-1.4288
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-6.0683
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress up for the neighbourhood .	-3.3015
Today I have become more of a Halloween muffle .	-3.6514
In the last two years , I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment , and I do not think I will do so this year either .	-5.4117
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween .	-2.7890
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Retailers Association ( NRF ) .	-4.0195
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-3.8046
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-3.0061
This year , exciting unlived objects are the last cry .	-4.1893
Women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes ; they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .	-4.6704
As for men , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into the Instagram Feeds this year .	-4.6972
According to Google , the most sought-after costumes are zombies , Batman , pirates and witches .	-1.9530
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.1008
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone to my surprise .	-3.6673
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes for their pets , according to the NRF .	-2.3392
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-1.6819
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not shy .	-3.6313
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , The Nielsen Company says .	-2.2863
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars , lollers , sweets and rubber balls .	-4.3716
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Department of Commerce , who drag through the neighborhood with the slogan “ Sweet or Saures . ”	-5.1466
In fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not delude ourselves – eat .	-3.4307
The only thing we do not want to consume is sweet Candy Corn ; however , 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of Chocolate Manufacturers .	-4.7448
That is about nine billion maize grains .	-2.3923
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.8273
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses where it spits .	-3.3907
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is in a real jail ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.4209
In fact , there are 1,200 officially recognized Spukhäuser in the United States , which generate $ 500 million in revenue , according to America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photos on which you can pinch your pants and then put your friends on Facebook , where you won ’ t get them back , and then one of the types on which you stand leaves a nice comment like “ facial expression . ”	-8.8861
But let us finally come to the pumpkins .	-3.1490
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great pumpkin when we were children , and carving a pumpkin lantern is like smashing the Christmas tree – something we have made from small .	-4.9812
Fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin rather than sitting in it .	-3.6928
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin , according to the US Census Bureau .	-1.9584
The pumpkin lanterns , slowly rotting in the front garden , probably come from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year .	-6.4364
If you want to score points , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and get some pretty things out of her 921 kilo pumpkin .	-5.1869
Fires in Helmets : Bailouts Assured	-6.0750
The fire department had to leave at Helmbrechts on late Thursday evening .	-6.1259
A three-family house in the County of Hof catches fire at night .	-3.3729
The rescue forces are carrying a charred body from the house .	-3.8568
Rescue workers have found a charred corpse in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrecht .	-8.3293
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-4.3181
On late Thursday evening it burned on the ground floor of the house .	-3.0608
When the fire department arrived , the flames hit out of a window .	-3.8971
The staff went to the apartment and found the body in a room .	-3.6549
This and another room burned out completely .	-3.2021
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.5822
All the other residents were not at home during the fire , the police officer continued to explain .      .	-6.4810
The building is no longer habitable .	-3.2607
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .	-2.0274
Germany ’ s largest national church has an offensive army to promote the profession of pastors .	-6.7450
The background is a possible parsonage : the Evangelic-Lutheran State Church in Hanover expects that the number of its currently 1,800 pastors and pastors will be halved by 2030 .	-7.0561
For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-4.0153
It is attractive to be able to determine the workflow of the day and work .	-4.4638
For the first time , the Church of the State commissioned a pastor on a full site to inspire young people to study theology .	-5.3962
At present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation .	-3.8763
Burfien this to the process of secularisation : " God 's voice is silent , the world is loud " .	-3.5342
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-3.2423
I am the master of my appointment schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.0605
Pastors could be very close to the people as pollsters .	-4.0945
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .	-2.8798
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .	-3.8024
This will meet today ’ s young people , who are not just about careers , but about a meaningful job .	-5.0334
According to the National Church , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year .	-3.8687
At the same time , some 40 graduates of a studies of theology begin their careers .	-5.0799
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz , the Emsland and the Wendland , it could become difficult to fill jobs in the future .	-4.4215
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-5.2094
Theology studies offer a broad education .	-3.9289
You can even become federal president .	-3.4244
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-1.0047
The interior features racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system .	-3.8427
The options range from enhanced brakes , a service package with the support of Bowler-workshop mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-5.2358
Drew Bowler , CEO of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-3.2410
They are not all experienced drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events .	-4.7358
We are happy to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare newcomers for the strains and the reality of Rally Raid .	-10.6058
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it ’ s going to be an entertaining championship .	-4.4228
The Defender Challenge also features a training and test day in February , as well as the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-4.4343
Fire brigade called to rescue a bitch who sat 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock jump in a quarry .	-4.9675
Cockerspanie-bitch Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident .	-3.7857
Three days later she was discovered by a wanderer in the quarry in her unfortunate location .	-8.4441
Fire fighters roamed on the rock face and rescued the dog before safe death .	-5.0699
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing a bitch into safety , who sat on a 15-metre lead in a rock wall .	-6.9163
The nine month old Cockerspanel bitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.5692
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the Flappit Quarry in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.7600
They were desperate to look for their missing bitch and published calls for help on social networks when she had escaped the small traffic accident in the quarry .	-8.0716
Around 2 : 15 pm on Wednesday , a pedestrian who executed his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high drop in the quarry .	-7.1264
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheath Fire Station rushed to the spot and took off to rescue Rubys , which was then transported up in a dog box .	-5.9615
Andy Clayton , a specialist in the technical rescue team , said , “ It was in a dangerous state .	-3.1612
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-3.9371
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .	-4.0705
But now she is doing well .	-1.8906
She then eaten some dog cakes .	-3.8375
This was a rather unusual assignment .	-3.1905
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-2.0272
Peter Lau , a specialist in the technical rescue team , said , “ Ruby had a huge fortune . ”	-3.8674
It was possible that she was very seriously injured or worse .	-3.0216
Ruby was taken to the vet , but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration .	-5.1283
Becky Hall of Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ Watching the rescue was scary . ”	-2.9822
I could not believe that she really was up there .	-3.0741
It was wonderful to keep them in the poor again .	-1.8785
The vet explained that if the exhaustion had become too big and collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-7.0706
The firefighters have done a great job .	-2.4896
What they did was truly courageous .	-2.5312
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.7279
Scott Alderson of Keighley added , “ We were afraid that she would fall down , but she stayed up . ”	-3.4141
The firefighters were great .	-1.4586
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.6898
Mick Jagger explains that he never hired Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.9057
On an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she worked as a backing singer on Jaggers ’ song “ Old Habits The Hard ” from 2004 .	-4.3250
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker and that “ he caught me up when I was 18 ” .	-4.3596
She added , “ This has been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”	-3.4128
In a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever attempted to approach Katy Perry . ”	-4.3671
The representative added , “ Perhaps she has confused him with someone else . ”	-2.9267
Perry was one of the singers who performed at the Rolling Stones Tour this year .	-2.8122
Their new album “ Prism ” came first this week .	-3.7232
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives Scots the choice .	-4.3433
A new day , a new story of terror about independence .	-2.7165
This time , we are being warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-7.7089
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian 's Wall .	-4.5886
Indeed , the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that would entail more freedom of movement in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , this did not matter in the headlines .	-6.8691
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is cheaper for them .	-3.5139
Given that Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , continuing disregard for Brussels would be just a small concession in exchange for what one really wants from the Scots .	-4.2768
So no story .	-3.4105
And one that has come so many years ago that it already resembles a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” -duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.3629
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-3.6768
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European tune ?	-2.0884
Why replace the London yoke with that of Brussels , especially now ?	-2.7169
These are the real European news : the great postwar plan for European unification has stalled .	-3.6521
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-1.7923
Across the EU , parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro out as a single currency are gaining ground .	-3.6189
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Alternative für Deutschland party – founded just this year – was able to win nearly five million votes in the September federal election , effectively driving Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .	-5.4849
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-2.2491
The current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .	-2.1012
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , in conjunction with the straitjacket to which the national economy is being coerced by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-5.8692
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments ’ excessive budget deficits – only in Greece .	-2.8211
Instead , the Eurosystem has stuck its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave it that way .	-5.1284
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity decline over Germany .	-5.3268
The only way is to cut wages and public spending , spurred by Berlin .	-2.3554
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.3096
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code to subsidise French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.6257
This is a crippling cost side , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-3.4608
All wage plates in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being sidelined by cheap American shale gas .	-6.9519
As a result , a revolt is looming , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.6259
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle for keeping Germany in check and raising Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-3.0733
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe , with which the French economy is struggling .	-4.6440
As a result , Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , pointing the ruling socialists to third place .	-5.6492
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing split would automatically benefit the left .	-4.4216
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the white working-class French ?	-6.1796
It wants to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-3.4218
If anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.8609
That is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-4.1674
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” favored by General de Gaulle .	-2.6454
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.6953
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of pandering to the United States .	-3.1115
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone .	-2.9561
Where is Scotland in all this ?	-2.9330
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) small England .	-2.2984
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can stick to .	-3.8043
I suspect that if we retain our own currency , Scotland could do well in a looser European union .	-4.9927
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations . ,            e e e e	-7.4804
Otherwise , we should consider doing so in the same way as Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-3.5763
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , winning a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection in 2011 of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for .       e e  e e e e e e e e e e	-8.1602
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to have austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .	-3.7360
Early puberty : Grown faster .	-2.7894
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts , as research shows .	-11.1563
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty .	-1.8269
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.3430
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a catalyst for early puberty .	-1.9871
Early puberty is less pronounced among boys .	-2.8138
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-2.3468
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and pubis at the age of seven or eight ?	-5.4994
At the American Academy of Pediatrics ’ s annual conference this week in Orlando , Florida , Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-4.7186
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is now fast , ” said Kaplovitz .	-5.3326
Obvious indicators of development , such as growing breasts , pubic and axillae , and body odor , can be seen earlier in girls .	-6.1588
However , there was only a slight shift in the age of menstruation in the last 40 years .	-4.1620
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.6625
“ When breast development begins , it will take at least two to three years to go to Menarche , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early puberty in girls : The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-6.4762
Time is the most accurate test of puberty .	-2.5918
It is controversial what actually marks the beginning of puberty , but it is “ premature ” when the breast augmentation is accompanied by a surge of growth before the age of eight .	-5.9968
In most cases , the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely .	-2.4928
With faster progress , tests could be indicated by an endologist to avoid serious problems such as tumours or cysts .	-6.3216
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and preventing another consequence : the premature ageing of the bone , which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and therefore small body growth in adults .	-7.3457
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .	-3.6732
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.0991
Kaplowitz is reluctant about drugs , but he admits : “ The suppression of puberty can alleviate girls ’ behavioral problems and feelings , unlike being their age peers . ”	-5.9823
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-2.1729
“ They care about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-3.3554
“ It was a shock , ” recalls a woman whose daughter received ten days .	-3.4268
Although there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was emotionally unprepared .	-4.3568
She came home scared and excited by the school because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-2.6824
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.6693
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media would be the cause .	-3.5988
Young people get puberty similar to girls in the past .	-5.0429
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the obesity epidemic .	-2.5387
He supported carrying out a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine , which establishes a link between body fat and puberty .	-5.2322
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.6158
In that country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers .	-2.4251
There are different explanations for this .	-1.8581
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions to the climate to the genes .	-3.5504
Another mystery : although boys are already growing face and shame , the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as strong as in girls .	-5.9875
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasised the complexity of the issue .	-2.8710
The appearance of acne and pubis is common even in babies and infants .	-4.1860
“ We must be careful about identifying the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.1878
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician how to talk to their child .	-2.8061
“ This can mean having to talk earlier than expected , ” said Kaplowitz .	-4.1072
If you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .	-3.0608
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than thought .	-4.3367
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width when large orders are made .	-5.4532
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the breadth of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-5.5880
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines are most concerned with , but this designated area is the key to efficiency claims in the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . aircraft .	-6.5731
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-5.6744
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft and are expecting record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-5.5286
How the rear part of the aircraft is structured – in particular , whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design is supposed to deliver .	-6.2096
Boeing claims that its upgraded “ 777X ” holds 406 people in the tourist class , which is over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row .	-5.6215
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inch wide tourist class seats , with nine per row .	-5.1261
Aircraft giants often report technical details through advertising in the trade press .	-3.4671
Airbus is now making a direct appeal to the public at the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to run with more than 100 orders .	-4.5766
Recently , the company issued an advertisement that could mark the start of a new advertising war , showing donors an image of three people squatting in a restaurant , with the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.9415
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-drops , ” says Airbus Chief Executive John Leahy .	-3.9899
With food habits changing , people become thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-3.7862
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-range travel , and by the end of the century , the average male American weight increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to US Department of Health data .	-4.9475
According to US health statistics , the waist range of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm .	-3.8156
Airbus says that its rival is based on a 1950s seat concept , when the average body size of the freshly baptized “ jet set ” was narrower .	-5.2617
According to Airbus , studies have shown that an additional duty ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 % .	-5.1789
Boeing denies Airbus ’ figures on seat sizes and says it is not at manufacturers ’ discretion to decide how airlines strike a balance between fares and equipment .	-6.0655
The company also explains that the aircraft experience depends on more than the seat width .	-4.2758
“ It really is about giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to succeed , ” explains Boeing ’ s air carrier expert Kent Cramer .	-5.6492
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.2772
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.5519
Passengers are concerned with more elbow clearance , but for manufacturers , it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-5.7568
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-5.2852
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle for the new jets .	-3.2741
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 36-seater Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.2074
The findings of Boeings depend in part on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-3.8416
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row .	-3.7279
“ Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus .	-4.6473
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row for existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for tighter arrangements , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-5.8539
“ Eighteen inches of seating width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is driven by the threat of the 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin facility , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-5.0438
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but rather a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-3.3149
The globetrotter jet sellers even carry bandages to measure the setup by the competition .	-8.0260
Even if they offer comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.5237
Airbus offers a 10-seater A350 , but has not sold it .	-5.3971
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of enhancing cabin adaptability and offering wide seats on the aisles for some jets .	-5.0087
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be missed , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.3663
A New Anti-nicotine vaccine Could Kill Smoking Fun	-5.6936
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-4.6712
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life .	-2.9902
Further tests are needed before human tests are carried out , which may take a few years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-5.4076
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market , but have seen their addiction to nicotine is stronger than these approaches , ” says Cornell .	-5.8091
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information on the manufacture of nicotine antibodies .	-3.6867
The virus selectively infects liver cells , which then produce a constant flow of antibodies .	-2.4872
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain , which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high .	-4.4851
In tests , vaccinated mice , which were administered by nicotine , maintained their normal level of activity .	-3.6139
By contrast , non-vaccination mice would have taken a “ time-out , ” the researchers declared , a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains .	-4.8612
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .	-2.1346
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.5058
Vaccines had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical to maintain the antibody level .	-4.2279
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower , as it turns liver cells into antibodies .	-2.9936
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for humans , if safe , could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine addiction .	-3.6584
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to quit .	-2.6026
“ They then know that when they start smoking again , they will no longer enjoy smoking because of the nicotine shock , which helps them to lose their habit , ” he explains .	-6.7135
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-3.0126
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid .	-1.9082
The former Minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is being charged with investigating corruption by the government .	-6.6866
The former NSW minister denies that he has changed the regulations on maritime pollution at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden holdings in three land holdings in state-controlled land .	-6.7873
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various state ministers to extend lease contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeid ran two restaurants and a café without a call to tender after the end of August 2005 .	-6.7691
It is now being investigated for allegations that Tripodi had known about Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the land after Tripodis ’ former deputy deputy chief Lynne Ashpole had announced on Thursday .	-8.9463
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for leases .	-3.6580
The tenants opposed this and also wanted longer maturities .	-3.4674
In 2009 , the lease contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay , which brought $ 2.5 million annually to the Obeids , were extended without public tender .	-6.3828
Tripodi , who was Minister of the Port from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally spoke in favour of public tenders .	-5.2948
But he refused to make the changes at Obeid ’ s request , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a change in the government ’ s leased areas .	-6.1451
A telephone publication presented by the ICAC showed conversations between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had changed to the Ministry of the Port after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-6.8783
“ Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the preparation of commercial weighting schemes ? ” , Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-5.4548
" No , " answered Tripodi .	-2.5672
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-2.3628
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.0741
Israeli fighter planes attack Syria , official sources say .	-3.8898
Israeli fighter planes had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night , a senior government official confirmed Fox News .	-3.9377
The official did not explain what the goal had been , but said that it was at least one .	-7.8113
According to the Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125-rockets .	-2.3113
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out missile strikes in Syria .	-3.2543
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to a “ COA test . ”	-4.1897
The government is considering a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures .	-5.2143
If the test were to be introduced , it would be used by means of a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for bringing family and friends to Australia .	-5.8424
Today , a government discussion proposal was published after former members of the Laboratory Party , Maxine McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers because they could be perceived as insulting by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-5.5700
“ Tough statements like “ foreigners should sit back ” and , first , Australians , are a very unpleasant relapse in times when labor unions demanded a sheltered labor market , ” she told the Australia India Institute today .	-7.2272
Historically , this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region heard an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.4815
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once thought up by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-5.0377
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on smuggling of human beings , implemented five of the proposed changes , while others are still being considered .	-4.5639
If the “ criterion of authenticity ” is adopted , then someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether “ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-6.6722
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers ended up leaving hundreds .	-4.8119
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week .	-3.7310
The disturbing nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been cared for since his father ’ s death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat .  .	-8.2397
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.2812
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland .	-3.3140
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to establish high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England as early as the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .	-4.9831
Minister of Transport , Baroness Kramer , said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.9876
The Scottish Transport Minister , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-3.0786
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.4961
After phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-3.3677
In June , the government fixed the estimated cost of building the high-speed rail between London and North England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-3.2359
The UK Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-5.5221
This includes the possibility of a three hour or less journey from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.4934
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-6.9542
We are proceeding with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-3.7670
Without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .	-2.5539
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.9598
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-3.0327
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown called for Carmichael to be “ unequivocal ” about Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-4.2312
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link holds the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic strength provides an argument for rapid rail connections throughout the UK . ”	-5.6238
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which provides benefits for all and complements the Glasgow Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.5174
I look forward to examining the study report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .	-7.5130
Electronic equipment regulations in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being .	-2.8747
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at launch and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such devices .	-5.1726
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers on their equipment can read e-books , watch videos , or play videos during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-5.0436
Passengers are already permitted to do so for most flights , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and landing .	-5.2099
Australian companies are monitoring the decision to do a great deal of work for US airlines , but do not have any immediate plans to change their rules .	-5.9111
CASA , the air traffic control authority , also stated that the announcement will be viewed , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment during critical flight phases in Australia still apply .	-6.4254
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft , ” was announced .	-4.0705
The issue is subject to rules requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew .	-4.9969
Virgin has already had talks with CASA about extending the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights , stating that they are open to change , but they should be initiated by the legislature .	-6.8839
“ We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic equipment by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-4.3201
Qantas said that the current rules will remain in place until further notice .	-3.4434
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices must not be used at launch and landing , and we currently have no plans to change this , ” the company explained .	-5.1964
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-2.0454
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers , and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-5.0015
The decision has different effects on US companies depending on the age of the fleet .	-4.4438
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate wireless disruption through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs , and customer instruction .	-5.1605
“ Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at any height , ” the FAA announced .	-5.0187
In rare cases , the crew will advise passengers to turn off the equipment during the landing .	-7.0369
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stowed under the seat or in the compartments over the seats at take-off and landing .	-5.3957
In front of Schalke ’ s revierderby , the BVB supporters with light missiles had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-8.7717
Borussia Dortmund announced tough consequences .	-2.9807
Before the Friday match of the football Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart , the ultra-s reacted with a silence - initially .	-6.2925
It was an unusual , almost ghostly acoustic that offered the spectator the signal Iduna Park until shortly before the whistle of the Bundesliga match between the German Vice Champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart Stuttgart .	-6.7571
Most of the guests were heard with their singing .	-4.0365
In contrast , the southern gallery , where the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans are standing , initially presented with exceptionally quiet : no chants , no calls for slaughter .	-8.2200
The pedestal of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint firing , remained vacant .	-3.4139
And at the front of the grandstand there was a big flag with the inscription " section stadium ban " .	-9.0248
Only Roman Weidenfeller , the goalkeeper , as always the first BVB player , was able to fire short-term jubilation .	-7.8447
When his team mates followed , there were loud vocals and woeful shawls - but far from everywhere .	-4.4789
Nothing rained in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery .	-4.0942
Also that Stadionsage Norbert Dickel once again counted the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory , Arsenal victory , Jürgen Klopp 's extension of the contract - did not cause a celebration .	-7.8617
Only five minutes before the whistle , the Capo reached its pedestal - and until then it was almost with the hands of tangible tension that flared out in a loud cry , when Dickel , as usual , asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-10.4516
Last but not least , it was the turn of the Southern Stand - and finally the loudest place in the stadium .	-7.3859
And at the latest when the loud call from the southern gallery " Derby Winner is up " came , everything was again as usual .	-7.2888
The silence before was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-3.4259
Just before Reviderby at FC Schalke 04 , some of the BVB ’ s most successful supporters had fired light missiles into the spectator ’ s ranks and into the seat – almost having hit Roman Weidenfeller ’ s goalie .	-9.6472
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes .	-1.4429
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tips of the Dortmunder ultra-s in his office - and according to Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives .	-5.7146
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement , " the BVB-Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-3.6374
As an immediate measure , Watzke denied the ultra-s a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart .	-4.0753
" I have banned that , " he said .	-3.0866
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.3502
In addition , the ultra-s have been shown various ways of punishing them - until Tuesday they have time to choose one .	-5.7553
Otherwise , according to Watzke , the BVB will establish a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.5613
" That 's going to be drastic , " said Watzke .	-4.0522
It is interesting to see how the reactions in the southern gallery will turn out .	-5.8627
Deposit houses are booming in Singapore , as the crisis has hit the middle class .	-3.3465
In a security house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelets , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters .	-5.3008
“ My husband and I have just bought a house because my money is in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-4.3816
Although she earns $ 3,000 ( $ 1,730 ) per month as an administrative worker and her husband also works , monthly family income does not suffice , she explains .	-9.9715
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that , this week , ValueMax , where it has bartered , became the third pawn listed on the Singaporean stock exchange .	-5.7584
Obtaining jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-4.4181
Typically , pawns in Singapore demand an effective annual rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center .	-4.3638
However , deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need to verify creditworthiness or proof of income , which is why loans are possible faster than banks .	-5.9289
For this reason , millions of people in the region turn to security houses , as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-5.0531
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policies in the developed economies , low-income and middle-income families are looking for security houses to compensate for the difference in struggling economies .	-5.9530
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor 's growing household debt , mainly due to rising mortgages , described it as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks .	-4.2788
According to the agency , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product .	-3.2806
Malaysia is at the top of the list at 80 % of GDP , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-3.4894
Economic economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has just emerged from a technical recession this week .	-4.2903
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a drop in consumer demand .	-3.2852
“ In the end , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle to lower segments ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , an economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-5.3527
Historical highs at gold prices over the past two years have intensified the trend toward pledging personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn the family ’ s jewelry into cash .	-5.7338
In Singapore , about 70 percent of the pledged objects are gold in the city state 's 200 security houses .	-4.4365

The largest Thai security house operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % customer increase in its stores in recent months .	-4.4071
The deposit business growth is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-5.1749
The company is financing this with 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week in Singapore .	-5.3426
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that deposit houses not only offer more favorable interest rates than other lenders , but also do not directly raise the debt .	-6.1813
“ Customers insult items they already own , and the liquefaction of personal assets does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-4.4413
The Pfandbrief business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term , secured financing .	-3.5357
Also , not all people using the deposit loan are in financial difficulties .	-6.5504
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax 's stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .	-4.4043

Australian $ 325 million rescue package for Tasmanian Health Services	-6.5798
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions associated with the $ 325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money .	-4.1604
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions .	-4.5750
The financing for a period of four years was decided on following consultations with the independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-5.9037
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” said Plibersek today .	-4.5236
The $ 325-million package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid for election benefits .	-3.7288
Further 2600 operations , including orthopedic procedures and cataracts , aim to eliminate residues .	-5.1810
In addition , there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better post-in-patient care , medical education , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-5.0312
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected clinicians told me that they were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , ” Tanya Plibersek said .	-4.8098
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government .	-3.3204
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money was spent .	-4.2093
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-2.6531
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by genuine reforms that put the public Tasmanian health-care system on a more sustainable course . ”	-3.8795
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he initially expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.9014
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the care list for the state ’ s public health system , ” said Wilkie .	-4.4949
According to the state government , these benefits will largely offset recent cuts .	-2.4468
But the opposition ’ s public-health spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ cobblestone solution . ”	-3.5966
“ We are in a position today because the laboratory government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health care system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-4.1364
It is not acceptable that a government should pull nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and put 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretend that this is good news .	-5.7877
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-3.7566

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , according to a monitoring group .	-3.2677
Syria has destroyed important facilities to manufacture chemical weapons and Gitftgas ammunition , the global chemical weapons monitoring group declared on Thursday , while in the north of the country there have been severe clashes near one of the sites where toxic substances are alleged to be stored .	-7.1048
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began three years ago .	-3.9734
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date on .	-3.8871
1 November , which the Hague based organisation , Damascus , had set up to destroy or make ‘ inoperable ’ all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities , including all machines for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition .	-5.7237
The completion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.8594
The destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.4548
Damascus must , however , begin to destroy the weapons and supplies that exist .	-4.3197
It is believed that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and Sarin nerve gas .	-3.8334
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira took place on Thursday , when experts say that there was a chemical weapons and storage facility here , as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in Great Britain announced .	-5.6319
The activist group , which is following the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120.296 people died .	-4.7820
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-2.2790
The government included 29.954 of them in President Bashar Assad ’ s army , 18.678 being pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.2095
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-3.6933
On July 25 , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011 .	-2.7690
This number has not been updated yet .	-2.0027
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country .	-1.8323
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of which have links to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.7392
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .	-3.1242
The fighting highlights the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors face , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-4.3268
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and experienced the destruction of all the major production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria . ”	-4.6692
As a result , “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-5.4252
Earlier this week , the inspectors said that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus .	-3.6958
The inspectors said that it was impossible to visit two facilities because of security concerns .	-3.9679
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites had been “ abandoned <unk> and the existing objects of the chemical-weapons program had been moved to other designated facilities that were inspected . ”	-5.6619
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira site was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.8644
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved by the OPWC ’ s executive committee next month .	-3.5918
“ I salute the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uzucu , Director General of the Monitoring Organization in a commentary published by OPCW .	-6.0300

With regard to further developments , Rami Abdurrahman , the leader of the observation group , said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-4.4730
The cause of the explosion was unknown , he explained .	-3.2526
Wrath of the Bali bombers	-2.1657
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted angry at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be brought to justice , because Umar Patek believed that they should be shot dead by law .	-7.3783
Patek , who was just under ten years as one of Southeast Asia ’ s most sought-after refugees , was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing .	-5.4737
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment .	-3.1931
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.3927
A condemnation was also made in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .	-3.6465
The prosecutor had called for a life sentence , even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , for his reputation as a masterful bomber , is also called the “ Demolition Man ” .	-6.6422
The decision raised painful memories of June Coreen , a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin killers Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago .	-4.6646
Fighting with tears , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.5408
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-1.7794
“ You should put him in front of a firing squad , ” says Coreen versus AAP .	-4.8019
I have to live every day with no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again .	-4.3261
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when , on 12 October 2002 , a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 23 o 'clock .	-8.4546
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded an explosive backpack .	-4.1115
He fell into coma for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while hanging on a life-support system .	-3.9747
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-3.8209
In fact , this type should be given the death penalty above all else .	-3.9059
Let him live – no , there is no reason to leave him alive .	-3.3170
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much .	-4.0003
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be tried .	-2.8193
He withdrew almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later .	-4.1377
During the trial , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-4.7165
“ He didn ’ t stand up , ” says Coreen .	-3.5048
Until recently , he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-3.4331
The verdict came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which is being celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia .	-4.3563
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Coreen .	-2.6333
Patek can still appeal against his judgment .	-2.8644
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment on aircraft ( but not mobile phone calls )	-3.7869
Air passengers can now use their electronic devices to read , work , play , listen to music and watch movies from departure to landing , but not to make phone calls , according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the United States .	-6.4528
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.5048
At a press conference , FAA employee Michael Huerta explained how quickly they would be implemented .	-3.8327
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and the rules on equipment leakage in accordance with the new regulations .	-6.3405
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft .	-4.1565
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue .	-2.5069
“ Depending on the status of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-4.8227
At present , passengers need to turn smart phones , tablets , and other devices off when the aircraft doors are closed .	-3.7029
You may not restart them until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-4.4909
When boarding , passengers must turn them off and must not start again before the aircraft has landed .	-6.2415
Under the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at take-off , landing and on the rolling field , the FAA declared .	-6.4075
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to higher levels for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-4.5772
Laura Glading , president of the Professional Flight Attendants Association , welcomed the changes .	-3.1490
“ If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” said Glading .	-4.5429
To be honest , we are tired of having to feel like guardians on this issue .	-4.9036
Nevertheless , Internet connections for browsing , exchanging e-mails , text messages , or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited , explained the authority .	-4.5506
Passengers are asked to fly smart phones , tablets and other devices .	-3.3303
So still not “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the boarding gate .	-5.5193
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-5.3535
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited .	-3.8599
The regulatory authority for telephone conversations lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-2.5705
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at launch and landing .	-3.3895
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board , a national traffic safety expert on CBS News , said that mobile phones are still considered a risk .	-3.5545
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmitter masts , ” says Rosenker .	-5.6087
A consulting committee of the industry , created by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices .	-5.1440
In recent years , pressure on FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-2.8641
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCackskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid grounds for the ban .	-4.1981
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of devices has become ubiquitous .	-7.2689
Some studies indicate that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore the switch off .	-4.5718
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of interference of navigation and communication equipment by UKW radios co-operated by passengers , which were then the latest technological trend .	-7.2848
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that electronic interference does not make them anything .	-5.3263
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for several years when the height of the flight is reached .	-4.9950
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference .	-3.1332
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines , said Huerta .	-4.1184
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit far less radio radiation than previous generations .	-3.4108
E-readers , for example , only emit minimal radiation when you turn around .	-4.0588
But when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-4.0045
One of the proponents of easing restrictions on device use by passengers is Amazon.com.	-3.0377
In 2011 , company employees loaded a passenger airplane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find them .	-6.0656
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.7219
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the device 's malfunction was genuine , even if the risk was minimal .	-5.8622
Other committee members have said that there are only a few reports from pilots who were talking about equipment disruption to aircraft systems , and most of them are very old .	-6.5890
However , the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for the passenger to switch off the equipment in poor visibility conditions .	-6.3053
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adjustment for travelers who are now heavily equipped with technology .	-5.2516
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-3.0624
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island .	-4.7814
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island , was discharged into nature again .	-4.5859
The water rale was flown to Aberdeen last month with a helicopter , where it was crippled by the Scottish welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa .	-7.1508
Colin Seddon , head of the center , said , “ This water tunnel was probably a winter puller from northern Europe , which was held up by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-6.3088
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the island of Bohinj .	-5.8752
He added , “ He couldn ’ t fly further , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.6289
When they were released , the water rale was fit and healthy again .	-5.2121
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.8115
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who create wealth and work in Britain want to change our relations with the EU .	-3.8800
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders , asking them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.3431
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives representing roughly the UK ’ s size , sectors , and regions .	-4.2825
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.5772
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe , concentrating on countries that are modernising and growing , while EU states are stagnating .	-4.5544
They want government to favor new trade links with countries like China , India , and Brazil , rather than stopping the long and arduous process of reforming the arcane EU institutions .	-4.3747
In their view , on certain legal issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster .	-5.1395
There was widespread discontent about the single market , because , according to companies , the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed that they were traditionally the most pro-European .	-5.4921
Finally , and probably most of all , our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course to change the agreement , and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .	-6.9401
This insight , shared by companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the book of action back to Britain .	-6.0613
It is about a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain , at 16 % , would lead to a change of opinion in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum .	-5.7327
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate Britain ’ s terms for EU membership .	-3.7595
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power relations back to Britain from a renegotiation .	-3.7748
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.9064
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation .	-8.7470
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls a pipeline in Bulgaria the start of a new gas era .	-2.3103
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects , said the Gazprom Board .	-4.2805
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , Europe ’ s largest and most important project , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.3487
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.8803
South Stream is supposed to provide more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes across Europe .	-3.6014
A dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , raises the risk of conventional routes , as officials say .	-4.6043
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ eliminated forever . ”	-2.8863
Bulgarian consumers get gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015 .	-3.0568
According to Gazprom , construction work in other downstream countries is to begin on the planned year-end route .	-4.1728
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-2.0855

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA employees accused Jonathan Lord of sexual crimes .	-3.8412
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were charged with child sex crimes before charges were made against child care manager Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011 , as the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse found out .	-6.7579
But in the opening statement to the Commission , YMCA said that “ the organization never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse . ”	-5.0406
CEO Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences , and another in which a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children he was familiar with .	-6.8927
Hare said Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-3.3601
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that “ there were external YMCA reviews in which YMCA was recognized as the leading front line in child safety . ”	-5.9708
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-4.6636
Hare , who started with 21 at YMCA , admitted that management failed “ from me down ” in Lord ’ s recruitment and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of children ’ s safety policies .	-6.6417
Lord had been convicted at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA .	-4.5397
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.4293
However , Hare denied that YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord violations of children 's safety .	-5.4718
The staff said that they had observed violations , including that Lord was alone with children , that she was privately cared for as a baby sitter , that she was sitting on his lap , saying that he liked it , and that children had to play with his mobile phone .	-6.3896
Danielle Ockwy , whose superior was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the Chief of the Child Services , Jacqui Barnat , who was the Lords of YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time very remote . ”	-8.6088
The manager explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors .	-5.0218
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord affected their judgment , so they would not have reported him .	-5.2519
Hare explained that he told the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be learned by the organization from the “ Jonathan-Lord-incident ” does not affect the reporting of employees , and the board agreed to it .             e e e	-10.2980
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign up to confidentiality shortly after the allegations were made was made by the director of the YMCA 's Child Services , Liam Whitley .	-5.9381
He said that this would prevent the evidence from being contaminated , but that was “ over-zealous ” and poorly implemented .	-4.7256
The YMCA NSW was not a child safe organization in the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , an expert on child sexual abuse , the Commission .	-5.1829
He explained that there have been “ serious problems ” in hiring , reviewing , including , training , and overseeing staff .	-6.4747
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-1.3176
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-3.7493
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.6718
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade of leadership , Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British policy , and his comments have mostly been confined to foreign policy and his role as leader of the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers .	-5.3864
When asked whether he would like to return to the post of prime minister , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London as saying , “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-5.5730
When horse show experts joined in droves in Cardiff to select the horse of the year , they knew that there was a fierce competition ahead .	-6.2053
But no one was prepared for Fenton Kirkland , three years old .	-3.2871
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago , and his Shetland Pony Toffee strolled through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind .	-5.9249
The unbreakable couple , both equal , were praised for their appearance , behaviour and style in the annual competition organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Ruddy near Cardiff .	-5.5489
During his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had set up his plate fatigues in a freaky angle and led the two year old toffee through the ring . the e e e e e e e e e e e e e e .	-11.8809
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the Pony , which were well above his age .	-4.5225
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality .	-4.3587
Fenton had been given Toffee as a gift last March for his third birthday and since then practiced every day with the Shetland Pony .	-4.4438
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and Toffee are a great conversation . ”	-2.1073
They had to compete against the whole field and left with Goldpokal and Rosette .	-5.3666
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee , and we were all thrilled when he won .	-3.5080
All strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-4.4702
The little boy from Nantyglo , near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , who has been riding horses for over ten years .	-3.8784
Howells said , “ The whole audience was as electrified and everyone fired on him and clapped him . ”	-5.6215
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so tiny he did a fantastic job .	-4.1528
Fenton is mad about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to look after .	-5.5063
As he has started , it will not take long for him to be on the horse of the year – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.5186
As one speaker of the annual horse show said , “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to handle his pony . ”	-3.2609
Together they are a great team .	-1.2038
The jury rated Fenton and Toffee how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the lead ring .	-4.3796
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-4.6620
I am sure Fenton 's sweet clothing has helped to make it really fit the occasion .	-6.1371
The Chinese Newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after e  e  e  e  e  e  e   e e	-8.2541
A Chinese newspaper , which on the front page called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation , declared a press regulator to be reformed .	-8.4358
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had issued a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-3.1584
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a state-owned company .	-3.5472
Now , the New Express is being subjected to “ comprehensive recapitalization , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-5.8773
The “ Reconstruction Order ” was issued by the authorities for press and publications , radio , film and television in Guangdong .	-4.8731
Preliminary investigations revealed that the Neue Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several incorrect reports on the publicly traded company Zolion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-4.4337
“ The New Express editorial management was disordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-4.1434
She said that she decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporting authority . ”	-4.5109
In addition , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to carry out a full reconstitution of the New Express and recommended that the relevant authority be identified at the New Express and immediately check the New Express management team . ”	-7.0522
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoklion .	-3.4566
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-2.9067
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment .	-4.2070
“ In this case , I have damaged Zoomlion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he explained to the state news channel CCTV .	-5.5672
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame .	-2.4463
I realise that I acted wrongly .	-3.5738
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page , saying that it failed to check the reports correctly .	-4.3884
Several well-known suspects have recently taken confessions on television .	-3.9103
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year , which prohibited the authorities from forcing someone to accuse themselves .	-4.1995
Self-rail Drug Tunnel Between the US and Mexico	-5.5744
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway operations , has now been discovered .	-3.9932
The US authorities described the 120 by 90 centimeters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found .	-3.1279
The tunnel , which runs in zigzag patterns over a length of nearly six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.8231
There are countless unassuming warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs .	-4.7660
The authorities explained that the tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unknown .	-4.5174
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the court records .	-4.1032
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged with the property and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .	-3.4928
They face prison sentences ranging from ten years to lifetime if they are guilty .	-4.8085
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage canals .	-2.6211
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered since 2006 in San Diego .	-4.5037
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , challenging drug cartels to take their product quickly to consumers .	-5.2555
In 2010 , authorities found a nearly 640 meter long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana home to two warehouses in San Diego .	-4.5645
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other .	-1.4149
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.7783
In an interview , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other .	-2.5979
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of Flynn 's two years old .	-2.6742
Actor Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-3.2107
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " Life sometimes does not run exactly the way we plan or expect it " .	-5.0290
Kerr and he still loved himself , stressed the 36-year-old .	-4.0010
" We will support each other and love Flynn 's parents " .	-2.9394
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and their son Flynn was born in 2011 .	-3.3744
According to the Lexika , veganism is subordinated to vegetarianism , but it differs significantly from that .	-5.3766
Because , while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream , ice , or a powerful Edam , these delicacies are not on a vegan menu .	-6.7666
Milk , cheese , egg , in addition to giving up meat and fish , the vegan leaves off all animal products - even honey is denied .	-8.5613
What remains may be asked , but on closer inspection , the vegan food world is characterized by considerable ingenuity .	-6.6454
" Bread spreads are very popular " , says Ute Henkelmann , owner of the local reform house , which provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.4010
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse .	-2.6564
" In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian " .	-4.1293
At the turn of the century I took the next step and became a vegan .	-3.0880
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the choice of shoes , " says Proctor , who prefers artificial leather to normal leather .	-4.9520
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday things without animal products .	-4.8519
In the first place , vegan is his an ethics .	-3.5540
" I don 't want animals to die for me " , Proctor explains the maxim of vegans that covers all consumption behaviour .	-4.5879
Instead of grapes from burgers , agitators , or rubber bears , vegans quickly discovered new products , and enthusiasm rose .	-5.9629
" It 's a double bonus , " says Proctor today , " in fact vegan does not represent a renunciation , not an asceticism , but an enrichment " .	-7.0585
And it is precisely these conditions that led to the failure of some even more well-intentioned attempts .	-7.0858
" The search factor is a very important factor that allows many to give up quickly , similar to smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-5.8339
" Certain tastes are not determined by the animal " .	-5.2018
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.0249
" You can also create the same effect in another way , " explains the vegan .	-4.4295
For example , Proctor adds aubergines , mushrooms and a few vegans to a barbecue .	-5.5390
He pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , in which it should taste good .	-8.7470
Of course , one wants something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-4.0590
" It should taste , but this is not just to reduce animal food , " said Proctor .	-3.9259
He did not suffer from health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption .	-5.8771
For me the conversion had a positive aspect .	-3.2302
I do not take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content .	-3.9075
There are high performance athletes who feed only vegan .	-2.5691
" My blood values are excellent , I can often check out , " explains Proctor .	-5.1357
In particular , many Vegan critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12 .	-3.5528
" As animals are fed with animal feed rather than grazing on the pasture , it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 proportion is high in the meat you buy in the refrigerator " , Proctor finds .	-6.0526
Vegans also have the option of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-2.6880
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.4887
Proctor doesn ’ t have to go far to get food .	-6.3589
After all , there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-4.2212
I find everything I need on the spot .	-3.1397
Only from time to time I buy something special .	-2.5274
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but this is how " ordinary " finished products are known to be .	-4.6411
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally assumed .	-4.5930
" There is much to discover in the kitchen , with a few small knicks you can achieve good , if not partly better results , " says Proctor .	-5.5024
With his vegan cheese cake , Proctor was also amazed by his parents-in-law .	-4.7002
Family celebrations give vegans a new spice .	-4.7423
This has a new meaning when cooking together .	-4.6068
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-3.3369
Of course , he has also been skeptical .	-3.8047
Is my food no longer attractive to you ?	-4.6199
" Do I have to feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - you have to be a vegan .	-9.0651
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society " , Proctor does not want to impose an enclave .	-5.0755
And , more precisely , everyday life does not seem as vegan as expected - and vegans are not as restricted in everyday life as they are commonly thought .	-8.2165
Fast Food is also allowed .	-2.0494
There are lots of chips everywhere !	-3.7932
" Many Döner towns offer falafel , or even a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-3.6896
In a pizzeria , he switches to pasta , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .	-5.4635
The restaurants slowly adjust to it .	-3.8910
" When I started to feed vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult " , New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people , make them aware of it " .	-6.3325
" When enough demands come , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , " he hopes .	-3.4091
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei .	-3.3827
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu .	-3.5220
Vegan dishes are basically there for everyone .	-3.5430
Everyone can eat it , so they are just the opposite of exclusive .	-2.6065
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " Proctor notes .	-3.9293
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the most of it impossible from the outset , " says Proctor .	-4.4443
However , purchasing vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-3.9528
Especially when you learn to understand that peanuts of animal additives can also contain dyes , it seems that following ethics with so many hurdles and traps is a quick step away .	-9.7670
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives " explains the many ingredients , the food as well as cleaning agents .	-5.1101
" It is sometimes better to do small steps than stop or stumble , " says Proctor .	-8.5678
Veganism is an important moral line of thought .	-4.4477
Perhaps he does not quite manage to evade his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically .	-4.4150
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath .	-5.0750
The trading on Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon of German time .	-2.9855
In a communication , the operator was responsible for technical problems .	-2.6220
The other 11 US options markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.4704
The latest incident continues a series of minor and major failures with the stock exchange operator .	-4.6452
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for one hour due to errors in data transport .	-4.1223
In August of this year , there had been two breakdowns in one week alone .	-3.7362
First , because of technical problems , the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent a massive amount of faulty purchase orders to options markets .	-8.8784
As a result , stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and cancel orders .	-4.8596
Two days later , half of the total U.S. stock market came to a halt for several hours due to a computer panel at the Nasdaq exchange .	-5.5939
Last year , the IPO of Facebook also caused a stir .	-5.2898
Nasdaq systems had not been up to the tide of sales and purchase orders , later established the SEC stock exchange supervisor and rendered the company a record fine of $ 10 million .	-7.4420
Konstanz : Radler Rides 63 Years	-3.6786
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening , around 10 p.m. , had been on the road with a ladies ' bicycle on the left walking path from the station square towards Marktstätte .	-9.9565
Suddenly , when a 63 year-old man walked from a pub , the cyclist was unable to slow down in time according to the police .	-7.1920
In the following collision , the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house , falling to the ground later and attracted a 15-centimetre drop on the head .	-8.6644
A rescue truck team took the injured to hospital for medical treatment .	-3.6781
British police issue Assange with an extradition certificate .	-5.1764
The British police today handed over a certificate of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge and asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-4.0530
Scotland Yard said that it had delivered a “ call to face ” to the 40-year-old Australian , who asked him to appear in a police station , and added that if he did not comply , he would face arrest .	-7.7716
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden for charges in a sexual crime , after its opportunities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected its appeal to extradite earlier this month .	-6.0932
Because he feared that Stockholm would deliver it to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 , requesting political asylum for the South American country .	-4.8863
Scotland Yard “ sent a 40-year-old man an invitation to attend a police station at a time we chose , ” said a speaker .	-5.5381
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail .	-1.4817
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call .	-3.3635
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible charges of espionage after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks ’ investigative website .	-4.9447
Drivers , who were stranded between their legs with 210 km / h and a hot drink , receive $ 1,000 penalty .	-5.8340
A driver was fined $ 1,000 for driving up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs .	-3.2405
Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree .	-2.6807
After the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage tray between his legs .	-2.9097
Howie found himself guilty before the municipal court of Colchester without having taken the necessary care and attention .	-5.9001
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban .	-2.4179
Howie has also been sentenced to pay $ 90 and a $ 100 victim premium .	-4.4234
Tax on Foreign Property Owners Against London ’ s Bubble	-3.4324
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is waiting for the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne , who had imposed a 7 % stamp tax on homes costing more than <unk> 2 million in 2012 , and annual fees for buyers who hold homes as a company and not as individuals .	-7.7520
Already , the revenue from the stamp tax on housing in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which was <unk> 708 million in fiscal year 2012 / 13 , exceeds the revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the northeast , north-west , Yorkshire , and the Humber region combined .	-6.0533
As Cook said , “ After increases in the tax on stamps on high-price housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against evasion , it is hard to say that high quality real estate is too low taxed , regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system . ”	-8.5151
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying property in London , or discourage owners from selling , ” he added .	-4.4365
First-class real estate – the top five to ten per cent of the housing market at a price – in London ’ s wealthy southwest belt , stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon , has increased by a record 11.8 % last year .	-5.9776
Prices in Central London had a steady annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” in which the southwest part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , according to Savills .	-4.7274
Scientists could shed more light on the connection between a dog 's tail and his mood .	-3.6128
Previous research showed that happy dogs with their tail moved more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left side for nervous dogs .	-5.9619
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.7639
Professor Georgio Valligara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ People know that the left and right brain halves react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.9884
Here we tried to see this with other species .	-3.5501
He also noticed that in dogs , just like in humans , the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .	-4.6834
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral swan of their species , the researchers monitored the animals while watching the films of other dogs .	-10.2618
They measured the heart rate of four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior .	-3.5982
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction or another .	-3.8632
Professor Vallortiga said : “ We have shown dogs films – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more left or right . ”	-6.4630
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wagging dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-5.0626
But if the tail ascent was mainly left ( again from the point of view of the dog who wags ) , their heart rate rose and they looked restless .	-5.8866
According to Professor Valligara , the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-3.8098
He is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience in which movements they should worry about and when not .	-4.6236
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and the wagging with the tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.4297
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners , veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal .	-3.9666
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol , stated that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs .	-5.5564
Last year , a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .	-4.2015
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs tend to go to a robot dog when their tail is wagging on the left and not on the right , rather than becoming restless – the other way around than in the Italian study . ”	-7.1976
According to his statement , the differences could be caused by the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .	-5.3696
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-1.7957
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” Bradshaw said .	-4.3565
But since their behavior is easy to record , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-5.3380
Arctic Monkeys postponed appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner ’ s illness	-5.1689
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed an appearance in Glasgow after her lead singer became ill with kethlkoponitis .	-5.0901
The band from Sheffield should play at Hydro on Friday .	-3.8192
Due to the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner , the concert has to be moved .	-3.7436
The band 's announcement came after they had already postponed their appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-4.6380
In a statement on its official website , the Arctic Monkeys said : “ After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening and at medical advice , the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday , November 1 . ”	-4.8946
“ Alex Turner has been diagnosed with a throat inflammation , which is why he cannot occur . ”	-4.9552
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20th , and the Hydro in Glasgow has been moved to November 21st .	-4.9698

Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals in February	-1.8111
Pope Francis will appoint new Cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-2.9366
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-5.2909
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-2.3624
However , a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the election of the Pope – that is , a group of 120 “ Cardinals eligible for election . ”	-5.8328
In a statement in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that a meeting of all the Cardinals would take place before the ceremony to appoint the new Cardinals , also known as the College .	-5.6911
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Council in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-5.2182
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February , the number of eligible cardinals would probably have fallen   .	-6.2347
He explained that a pope usually accepts as many cardinals as necessary to return to 120 the number of eligible cardinals , and as many cardinals over 80 as he would .	-5.6242
According to Valero , the Council is important next year because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year .	-5.4024
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , Italy .	-3.4553
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope , Cardinals from the rest of the world , will appoint to restore the balance , ” he said .	-6.6292
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.0234
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are charged with finding ways to reform the Church .	-4.7006
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-2.2816
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.9792
He said that it was “ possible ” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice .	-4.1228
So far , however , we have not been in this position – all this is completely new .	-4.9652
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called Cardinals from large places , but Francis “ fills with surprises – so we don ’ t know who he appoints . ”	-6.0803
GM is calling for new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seat rest .	-3.8608
General Motors is calling back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado- and GMC Sierra-Pickup trucks built in 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , a notice issued by the US automotive safety regulator on Friday .	-5.3179
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest .	-4.4805
For this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety on head restraints .	-3.5495
“ If the head restraint is lifted from behind to the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-6.6703
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-3.8017
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-4.6822

An Obama Vote ’ s Despair	-2.4563
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-2.1598
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republicans ’ blocking tactics .	-3.1705
Blockade Policy doesn ’ t apologize for Obamacare ’ s Web site problems , the drone attacks .	-4.1214
Obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been possible .	-2.3929
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School .	-2.4438
I am reading a terribly sad book .	-2.4297
It is a book that I thought would brighten up and give me hope during my second year of medical studies .	-8.9734
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes Barack Obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 presidential election .	-3.6182
When I finish writing my patients in the evening and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics was able to inspire millions and take the breath of a speech .	-5.5823
The election was a landslide victory , and news spokespersons held to bear in mind the historic significance of this hour .	-5.4210
My classmates weeded with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-2.8041
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.0732
When Obama took office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval .	-3.1238
And then I close the book .	-1.2209
Turning back to the present is a rude awakening , as if you were torn out of a dream .	-4.1435
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminder , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.8874
In the years since I first voted , something has actually changed .	-3.0555
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.3696
I recognise the great and diverse things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-4.4551
I , too , believe that party political obstructionism has given way to too many efforts to move our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health option and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-6.1891
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end of my attempts to explain .	-4.0257
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.4454
Republican policy of obstruction cannot explain why tapping foreign heads of state is allowed or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-4.1945
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans ’ private lives and why whistleblowers are punished for public misconduct .	-3.2157
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential election .	-3.6001
It does not justify the results of a report that says that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration . ”	-3.3297
And , most recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.5127
I do not know if that is what I should have expected .	-1.8101
I should have understood , at 18 , that government work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it .	-4.7387
Obviously , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-4.6000
But when I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.0228
And that bothers me most .	-2.6824
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.6971
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative , he seemed unable to define his direction and positions .	-6.8204
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfill the hope that we have long heard of .	-4.0802
But , with the fall in Obama ’ s approval ratings to below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become all the harder .	-4.4690
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have evaporated into air .	-4.4134
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to face a severe loss against Clinton in the primary election in Pennsylvania .	-4.3468
In a meeting with voters after the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .	-4.9329

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave .	-1.8189
The billionaire and MEP , Clive Palmer , says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict with his plans for parental leave , because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit .	-4.3546
The mining magnate , who is in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , made the claim that he wanted to sweep questions from the table as to whether he was in conflict .	-6.3000
The Palmer United Party could control up to four Senate votes that are important to deciding whether carbon and mining taxes are being cut or cut .	-3.7834
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and Abbott ’ s daughters would benefit personally from the laws .	-2.6755
“ He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-5.1445
Two months after the election , the Palmer Election Commission , with 53 votes ahead of the recount , officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Palace of Fairfax .	-4.6387
Palmer called for a review of the vote-counting process to be carried out more quickly .	-4.1645

Why should we not have a system where you march in , enter the data into a computer , select immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-5.3766
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers .	-4.2336
Do you use them because you can wipe out the results if you don 't like them ?	-3.7434
It is incredible to vote with pencils today .	-3.8041
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.9843

RBS Runs Two Forex Traders	-2.8843
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , such as two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation into alleged currency market manipulation is rapidly underway .	-5.9114
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigation of the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion per day changes ownership .	-4.9759
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the widening investigation that the Libor interbank scandal entails .	-4.1148
The bank , which did not comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it received requests for information from authorities .	-3.3078
“ Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-4.0112
Last month , people close to the situation reported that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a previous merchant to the UK Financial Conduct Authority .	-5.0747
This trader , Richard Usher , had left the RBS in 2010 and is said to have been certified by his current position as European head of the forex spot trade at JPMorgan .	-4.9482
Rohan Ramchandani , head of European Spot Trading at Citi , was certified this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly leading currency trader at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-4.3832
None of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing .	-2.9748
Bankers in Barclays and Citigroup were part of the Usher instant message group , saying people close to the situation .	-4.0594
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees , after Finma , the Swiss regulator , had declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-5.1110
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority , Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently engaged in charges that bankers should have agreed to deal with currency market transactions .	-5.3775
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .	-3.5146
Banks comb instant messages and emails from several years in search of misbehavior .	-3.4686
The news of these investigations has stirred up traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year has been under pressure , because low currency volatility is limiting the chances for speculators .	-5.7860
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-6.6393
A leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks ’ own internal platforms means that “ you can influence the market even with very low ticket prices . ”	-5.7157
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had cancelled a London Exchange Traded Fund dealer this week after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year .	-5.7304
The Bank promptly informed and cooperates with the relevant authorities .	-2.9176
“ We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter was contained , ” Credit Suisse said .	-3.9070
The construction fence on the Bechtle plot painted .	-2.6440
A group of citizens ' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " has beautified the grounds on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.1239
She also cleaned and widened the footpath , it is said in a press release .	-3.9419
The planned cover of the crumbling house in the back of the plot was not allowed for security reasons , because the area is in danger of slipping .	-6.3699
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the property , had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI .	-3.9054
Before the BI action a banner with the message " We are for it " was put in place .	-5.5082
However , this did little to disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative in their actions .	-4.6235
Her motto on the large poster was " We are against construction ruins " .	-5.2802
In doing so , she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - if the giant project one day fails .	-6.0432
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the " construction site " , it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many , although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-6.3189
But they are beginning to resist , because the city is delaying these responses , says the BI .	-5.1776
As has been said , the mayor ’ s public statements also have an impact .	-4.5913
May said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the demise of the thermal bath if the public were to vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow .	-6.5764
Some of them seem downright scared , others perceive them as a " clumsy blackmail attempt " on the population , as the BI press release continues .	-8.1296
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers .	-1.7396
Rangnick Schelte for Schiris : Mane no Schwalbenkönig .	-3.6056
Although Ralf Rangnick is satisfied with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg , the sports director of the " Bullen " was disappointed by the referee .	-5.4772
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Schwalbenkönig " , he defended the two offensive players at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .	-4.3140
The most recent cause of Rangnick 's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3 : 0 against Grödig last Sunday , in which the Senegalese became an alleged acting act - which was not , of course , as the TV pictures showed .	-9.4520
" A stark misdecision , " Rangnick said , the referee Harkam called " completely overwhelmed " .	-5.7302
Harkam also " his part " would have contributed to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match	-5.4866
He strongly defended his German compatriot : " I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation " .	-5.0068
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with Hütter after the skirmish .	-3.4929
I do not know why .	-1.1624
" I am the one who was insulted , " said the 46-year-old .	-3.5113
In view of the success story , however , Rangnick agreed to praise .	-6.1604
" There are only two words for this : right , " he said .	-5.1430
There is not much to be said about .	-2.5018
The way the team plays is particularly impressive .	-2.5980
This should continue .	-3.6782
There will be no changes in the amount of traffic during the winter season .	-7.0749
There are no great reasons to change anything .	-1.9075
" In addition to a player , Rangnick made it clear that he would like to leave the club .	-7.4882
Supreme Court vindicates Obama ’ s Health Act	-1.9540
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely associated with Barack Obama is constitutional .	-3.7736
With five to four votes , judges ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ’ s single mandate – forcing US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority .	-4.2945
The Supreme Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy opposed it .	-4.5111
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law , and also argued that the health law ’ s requirement that states either have to extend the eligibility requirements for Medicaid or that all state Medicaid should be removed was not unconstitutional .	-8.0679
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-3.1005
The law had been decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the eventual challenger , Mitt Romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .	-3.1310
Norway ’ s Giant Mirrors	-4.0764
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley .	-3.4406
Due to the low level of sunlight , the Rwukan in Vestfjord valley is usually submerged in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-9.9740
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 metres , Wednesday saw a period of the century .	-5.6637
" Finally ! " , Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the launch ceremony at the broadcaster TV2 .	-3.7296
Some of the inhabitants of the valley were using sun chairs , while others were using sunglasses for safety .	-6.7063
Until now , sun-hungry people had to take a cable car to a nearby peak in winter .	-4.7877
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to channel beams into the valley with mirrors .	-3.4576
However , this idea has been in place since 1913 .	-3.9390
After several years of debate , the City Council finally approved the project , which was worth around EUR 615 000 .	-6.1720
A similar construction has given the Italian Alpine village of Viganella winter sunshine for several years .	-4.1967
Post Cleaning Little Sunday	-3.6646
" Many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red dots for Sunday emptying are still at various letter boxes in the core city and the districts , but if you read the small print on the yellow container of the Post AG , you quickly find out that emptying on Sundays and public holidays is no longer taking place , " the FDP informs .	-9.1334
A request from the FDP confirmed this .	-2.0766
On Sundays and public holidays , only before the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied .	-5.5130
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still frozen on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP ’ s question .	-4.6834
The FDP ’ s social and youth spokesperson Fritz Röhrenbeck wants to hook up here .	-4.9168
Sunday opening is an important postal service , especially in the case of terminal post .	-6.7430
" This effort is radically and unacceptably thin , despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013 . "	-4.7930
Thomas Bittner , Chairman of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , supports his group colleagues : " What annoys me is the fact that the idle periods are being changed or deleted in secret here " .	-6.4918
The postal service is a long way from being close to the people .	-3.8264
" At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-4.3498
For the core city , too , a toll , especially non-mobile , fellow citizens , would have to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday sweeping .	-9.1123
Röhrenbeck asked in the municipal parliament whether the city council is planning talks with the post office on this matter .	-5.9875
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post office did not communicate with Lamperheim .	-2.8536
But there is also a Sunday lecture in Hofheim to his knowledge .	-3.2258
Your party has , of course , advocated privatisation .	-3.7817
" Then decisions will be taken elsewhere , " said Maier .	-2.4735
Frankfurt parking charges are expected to rise sharply .	-4.1186
The room was very small and the bathroom was very small .	-8.1589
This morning , the city ’ s main office will discuss the presentation of the Transport Representative Stefan Majer ( Green Party ) .	-7.7380
As a result , parking fees will be increased by 50 percent .	-5.0675
However , it is not intended to raise prices , but to reduce the time interval for parking clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-8.6683
In December , the municipal council has to decide .	-6.6011
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this " not a good idea " .	-2.7370
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.1973
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is ' entirely appropriate and long overdue ' .	-4.1004
Public transport will also be more expensive .	-1.9586
Merely Host Fast Action	-5.6873
The men I of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen with a narrow  .	-5.7985
The elders stood with an experienced team on the other side of the net .	-3.9369
Soon , however , it became apparent that they could not fully compete with the fast actions of the joysticks , even due to age .	-7.3441
With the hard and placed impacts , the gods were extremely heavy .	-7.4765
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz gave clean across the middle of the network and were not there for block defense .	-7.1021
Two high first sentence gains clearly asserted the superiority of the states of joy in all matters .	-6.3145
In view of this crushing and game-determining achievement , the third set was won a little bit lash-free and lushly to the 3 : 0 end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-7.8180
There will be a much more powerful opponent in the field on 2 November with the TV Baiersbronn , which was able to get its way in Nagold .	-7.2270
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Papelchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Schulz Eduard .	-2.4257
In the B-Class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were competing in the Murgtal Hall in Baiersbronn .	-4.8814
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match .	-2.6227
On both sides , nervousness caused mistakes and point gifts , especially when it comes to accepting the ball ; even in the hands , precision was sometimes scarce , and in some critical game scenes , the zeal prevented the view for possible point gains .	-10.3497
However , in this highly balanced performance meeting , Marcus Blasutto ’ s TSV team consistently agreed to the great physical commitment and the positive commitment of both teams .	-7.8322
Nursing Day at the Small Engländerhütte	-3.6186
A group of dedicated participants met at the small Engländerhütte in Ibach at the 5th Nursing Day following the Natura 2000 project of upper Hotzenwald .	-5.8208
Due to suggestions from the population should be freed this day in the area of the hut the view into the valley , said Mayor Helmut Kaiser .	-4.9024
Many hikers , said Kaiser , described this area as the highlight of the Schluchtenstieg , where the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views .	-6.8505
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the nursing day is a suitable tool to strengthen the connection between man and nature .	-4.9572
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set a course in nature itself .	-4.3828
At the same time with the tourist aspect ecological consideration can also be taken into account .	-4.4809
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribuait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Government Headquarters of Freiburg after the welcome by the Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wished the action to be successful .	-8.4540
According to Tribuait , the tourist goal of the wide view is to preserve the now heavily grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected living space types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures .	-7.9334
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-3.5244
You need these free connections to the arteries .	-3.3677
Tribolait said she would not miss here to break a lance for the planned Biosphere Reserve .	-8.8469
The current measure does not only integrate seamlessly into this planning .	-3.9101
A Biosphere Area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the achievements of the Life Project as well as the previous nursing days for the future .	-7.2993
After these various presentations , the tour manager Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups .	-6.5739
The larger trees had already been beaten in the run-up to the event , and the forestry tractor would be ready to call you .	-9.2353
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar .	-4.4284
The goal was to have a clear view at the viewpoint .	-5.2791
Löffingen : Köpfler Still Only Candidate	-3.1303
Information on the Internet : Although the Baar town of Löffingen , with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school , children 's , youth and senior citizens ' policy , as well as its own municipal works , can be described as an attractive city , no other candidate has yet registered .	-6.7696
The only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger , who is no longer running for reasons of age , is the 46-year-old bank clerk and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen .	-6.7098
The application deadline expires on Monday , 11 November , at 6 p.m.	-3.7431
Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for patent rights .	-3.9759
On Thursday , the group that owns thousands of former Norton patents filed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was outbid by Nortel in the bankruptcy auction .	-6.7017
Rockstar , the consortium that had bought the Nortel patent for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringement at the US District Court in Texas .	-3.7345
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-2.3069
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.2352
The patents concerned technology that matches Internet search terms with relevant advertising , such as the lawsuit that hits the core of Google ’ s search engine business .	-5.4278
Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .	-3.4509
Samsung , Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft ’ s mobile products .	-3.9175
In 2011 , Google issued an initial bid of more than $ 900 million for Nortel patents .	-3.3037
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-3.0837
After outbidding Rockstar ’ s Nortel patents , Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly motivated by the Motorola library of patents .	-5.6956
“ Although Google has failed in its attempt to purchase the right of tender at the auction , Google has violated and continues to do so , ” said the lawyer .	-7.7191
Rockstar claims a high level of damages from Google because it claims that Google ’ s patent infringement is intentional , it is alleged .	-5.6922
Egypt ’ s sworn first freely elected president	-1.2104
Mohamed Morsi is sworn in , but his day of triumph is unlikely to mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes .	-3.3988
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn in as the country ’ s first freely elected president , replacing Hosni Mubarak , who had been expelled 16 months earlier .	-3.6441
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .	-3.5806
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes , which is based on the Nile and inspired by an ancient Egyptian temple .	-4.4691
“ We want a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony that was broadcast live on state television .	-3.9876
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy , and stability , ” said 60-year-old Morsi , a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its founding 84 years ago , has been targeted most sharply by the government as a banned organization .	-5.9252
Hundreds of soldiers and police watched the building as Mursi arrived in a small autoconvoi shortly after 11 a.m. local time .	-4.2788
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the court to cheer the new president , and unlike Mubarak ’ s presidential pomp , the traffic was only stopped for a short time , so that the autoconvoi could cross the typically busy road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-7.1951
As an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of Islamists , but also to all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .	-6.0009
“ Egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” said Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with a red tie , to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took office .	-5.3753
Later , Morsi went to the University of Cairo , where he should make his inaugural address .	-3.3043
He was officially welcomed by an army band playing the national anthem , which he listened to in the post .	-7.6255
The military leader , Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi , was present .	-2.7334
On his arrival , he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university ’ s largest auditorium with chants of “ The army and the people are a hand ” .	-5.5603
Built in 1908 as the bastion of secular education , the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s .	-3.2906
On Friday , Morsi made a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square , the birthplace of the insurgency that ended Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year , and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the head of state .	-5.4915
However , by submitting the official oath to the court , and not as usual before Parliament , he is bowing to the will of the military , indicating that the power struggle will continue .	-6.0749
Morsi ’ s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.5119

Workers Broken by Leader	-4.3786
On Thursday , a 51-year-old worker crashed from a ladder in Eggelsberg and injured himself severely .	-5.6838
The man from Lamprecnhausen wanted to replace a defective heater on the outside facade of a guest house .	-4.6873

Rapists in South Africa : Two Life imprisonment	-2.6041
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday .	-2.3803
This was reported by the station SABC .	-3.2599
The victim was later killed by the consequences of the serious injuries .	-3.1047
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime .	-3.0628
The act had caused horror nationwide .	-3.8960
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .	-3.7928
The doctors fought for the victim 's survival for 14 hours , but in vain .	-2.9956
The sight of the young people was so appalling that the nurses needed psychological assistance .	-3.7476
Kana admitted during the trial that he had been in a bar during the night of the crime .	-4.7279
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her , but he refused to be responsible for the death of the girl .	-3.6913
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators , but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was insufficient .	-4.8425
The prosecution also emphasized during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack .	-3.8950
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa . Every year there are about 64 000 people reported on sexual violence .	-6.6241
That is almost ten times as much as in Germany , but with 82 million people , it has far more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-4.7530
But the police and women ’ s associations in South Africa estimate the number of cases of sexual violence to 10-25 times .	-4.7402
Jumbo Goes to Black Forest Ham	-3.5357
Jumbo in search of the " best ham in the world " : For the TV broadcast " Galileo " visited the Pro7-Star Bonndorf .	-3.9327
At the beginning , the speaker made it clear that the most important thing for ham is the pig schools , but Turbomast is not a good condition .	-7.1440
Can ham that you get in any supermarket be a quality product ?	-3.8156
As head of the great Schinkenfabrik in the Black Forest , Jumbo explains the operation of the company " Adler " in Bonndorf .	-4.1781
" Germany 's favourite ham " , as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham .	-4.1481

Most pigs are slaughtered at six months .	-1.1765
Level television ?	-2.4161
Details such as the pH value of the meat also play a role .	-3.0549
The darker the meat , the higher the ph-value .	-1.4158
" I am curious to see if you can tell Roberto Blanco what will happen , " said Jumbo cynically .	-5.2214
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture .	-2.8983
But watching is still worth it .	-4.6767
The viewer sees that cutting the culls is still manual work .	-5.0539
Because : Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf .	-3.8181
The secret of ham is the mixture of spices and salt .	-2.3550
Jumbo 's smoke tower and fire are reminiscent of a submarine .	-5.7533
The trick : Tannenweige ensure the special taste of the Schwarzwald ham in the smoke .	-6.8042
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black .	-1.8859
" Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo " , he announces the test sniping .	-4.1720
" That 's really delicious " , says the TV star 's conclusion .	-4.9055
This will enable everyone involved to live .	-3.3284
You thought travel agencies belong to the past thanks to Internet ?	-2.9141
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend .	-1.7392
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and Great Britain .	-4.8872
The airline now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes to be between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its previous forecast .	-9.9333
If the current target is reached , that means 12 to 17 % growth compared to a record $ 290.4 million in 2011 / 12 .	-5.4544
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and had a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in Australian and British private business .	-5.5870
“ Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year , and some of them are well on track towards record annual earnings before interest and taxes , ” he said .	-4.0247
These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically among our strongest earnings earners .	-3.0151
In Australia , the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year , leaving a slightly weaker market for business travel .	-4.1173
It was similarly good for Flight Centre ’ s leisure activities in the UK , with business customers spending less .	-6.0171
The US business recovered from the seasonal weaker first half of the year , so that a profit for the third consecutive year is expected .	-5.6422
The shares of Flight Centre increased yesterday by 3 cents to $ 38.20 .	-2.9108
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics , spelling , and grammar .	-2.0929
In courses on English literature , students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare , a 19th century novel , romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 .	-4.6556
The test also includes “ unseen texts ” to encourage broader reading .	-5.1125
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished .	-2.6750

The Ministry of Education will publish the new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned .	-4.1510
Other core subjects will be changed next year .	-1.8573
In a separate initiative , Ofjel , the Supervisory Authority for Audits , will announce a reorganization of GCSE structures , including a new rating system and less course work .	-5.2403
In a speech in the summer , Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a “ broad consensus , that we need to reform our auditing system to restore public confidence , ” stressing that GCSEs would become “ more challenging , ambitious , and rigorous . ”	-4.6041
Studies show that in English schools , less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .	-3.4867
On average , Australian schools teach 143 hours a year , and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-3.5752
While there will be no formal requirement to allocate more time to mathematics in the timetable , coalition circles say that comprehensive Math testing , combined with greater emphasis on ranking , will probably encourage schools to spend more hours .	-6.6707
The curriculum pays more attention to “ problems of the right life , ” including financial mathematics .	-3.4469

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum	-2.0638
At the next Ecumenical Dialogue Forum on Monday , 21 October , at the New Museum of the Castle , the theme is " On hell with hell - Theological reflections on the way things are handled today " .	-6.8536
Lecturer is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.8852
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church communities of Salem , Salem Castle and the Kulturamt Bodenseekreis .	-4.9335
Johanna Rahner wants to examine in the forum the question of how people today started the " last things " after death .	-5.6882
If people had known too much about this over the past centuries , relying on the images of heaven and hell that " still shape our ideas " , contemporary prophetic teaching is more characterized by a certain embarrassment or even lack of language .	-7.0061
" The greater hope has been thoroughly exploited by the critics of religion by Christians , " says the speaker .	-4.8490
She " supplied us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks " .	-3.3187
Johanna Rahner continues : " But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death " .	-3.6073
This involves the question of the longing " which dreams of everything being good at the end " .	-6.3326
Johanna Rahner , born 1962 in Baden-Baden , studied Catholic theology and biology at Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-2.6682
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol . , also in Freiburg .	-3.4611
The Habilitation for Fundamentaltheology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University .	-5.0376
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner holds a professorship in Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel .	-3.4407
Geislingen : More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleines Heuberg confirm their faith in the company .	-6.9715
In two services , 101 15- and 16-year-old youths were insured for the ministry of the Lake District Am Kleinen Heuberg .	-7.4486
The morning worship was accompanied by the Laurato-Si group , in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit .	-4.9972
With the reception of the firmament sacraments , young people said yes to their baptism and inherited the power of the Holy Spirit .	-5.3497
In the last few months , under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of many community members , the Firmlings had prepared for the great Festtag .	-7.2940
In various projects they met different tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the Youth Day in UnterMacht .	-6.2508
Illmensee : Two Mountainbike Race Exciting Participants	-3.9321
On beautiful weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the round course over the hills around the lake .	-5.5219
Ulrich Knobel is a member of the organising sports association Illmensee .	-5.7725
Among the participants , especially at a short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous Jedermannsradler , who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere .	-6.2804
Two top German junior riders were also at the start of this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz recommended good places at the German Championships .	-5.3442
As expected , these two could move off the field .	-5.5841
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a small time forward to the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance .	-6.0038
On second place Pascal Treubel could once again place himself .	-5.8610
For the ladies , it was Theresa Duelli of the team 's nightmare that made it to the top of the podium .	-5.3361
On place two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie driver from Owingen .	-3.0813
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community .	-3.5597
Not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .	-4.5649
The age structure also reached from ten years for the youngest up to 70 years for the oldest starters .	-5.2034
In this year ’ s Main Event there were even more top athletes at the start .	-5.6597
Four drivers were able to stand out from the top regional drivers .	-4.5326
Among them Philipp Pangerl , a half-mountain bike professional from the Black-Tusk-Racing-Team .	-3.2359
Together with a team mate , Pangerl was twice the world champion in 12-hour driving .	-4.8373
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline .	-2.7988
Roland Ballerstedt , who already owns two German championships in the duathlon .	-3.7070
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude there was a breathtaking final in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall .	-5.5960
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line .	-2.9026
Only one second behind it , the Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings .	-5.8762
At the same time , Hermann and Warthmann joined the team as a third party in the overall rating .    .   .   ,	-6.6848
In the ladies ' competition Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race .	-3.9588
Areane Blersch from Binzwien in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart secured the second place .	-3.5262
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event .	-3.2453
On the Road through Mud , Rivers and Jungle for Free Medical Care	-4.8228
Doctor Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon .	-3.6325
BWave and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-1.9836
There are not many doctors in the West African country , only one for 5,000 people .	-6.4639
Vote here or with your mobile device	-2.0041
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013 .	-2.8748
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as CNN Hero of the Year .	-3.9154
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-2.4769
For 21 years , Georges Bwelle saw his sick father constantly losing consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-5.3547
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.5567
At first he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-5.4267
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” said Georges Bwelle .	-2.5399
We would have released it from Cameroon if we had the money .	-2.1612
Instead , Bwelle spent years helping his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.6315
“ It ’ s not easy , ” comments Bwelle .	-2.5177
You can leave the house at five o 'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-4.4599
There are many patients .	-1.4694
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.4007
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle 's father died in 2002 .	-1.9205
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .	-2.6925
In contrast , the relationship in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.6066
But even if there was a doctor for them , most of the Cameroonians could not afford to visit .	-3.9693
Two out of five people live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health spending is private .	-3.0726
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-2.0614
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-1.1869
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered in Bwelle made the decision to do something about this .	-4.2337
Last year , Dr. Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team carried out 700 free operations .	-3.7714
He became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.2392
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and provides free medical care .	-4.2425
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-2.8810
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people are forced into minibuses and , with the snowed-in medical equipment on the roof , drive over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help .	-6.2844
It does not always run smoothly .	-2.4858
More than once , they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-5.6447
But when they arrive , they will be welcomed like heroes : a feast , singing and dancing , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .	-4.6038
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and to celebrate – with his broad smile and boundless energy – at the happy celebration .	-6.4337
The next morning , the team then begins to study hundreds of patients .	-3.2417
“ We handle 500 people per trip ” , Bwelle says .	-4.6435
You can reach the village within 60 kilometres on foot .	-4.5056
Each weekend clinic offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.4153
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.5438
Others receive crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-4.2339
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia .	-3.3105
The surgery usually takes place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the surgery patients are up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next person .	-6.0374
Lighting for the operation and disinfection equipment is supplied by the group 's generator , so Bshaft and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday .	-5.9029
It is a strenuous effort , but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-4.3311
“ They drum the whole night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-4.4762
On Sunday the team then returns to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.4465
The group – a mix of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people it helps .	-4.8409
One man explained that the free operation of a Leistungsverbruch he received now enables him to work again .	-5.0987
“ That changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.6357
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in hospital , Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-3.9006
With this second job he financed 60 % of his charitable activities , according to Bwelle ; the rest comes from private donations .	-4.5581
" I really do not know when he sleeps , " says Katie O 'Malley , who in the second year studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and works voluntarily in Bwelles Group .	-4.2911
He is always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-4.3590
For medical and health care students like O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support BWave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-4.6084
“ We can be involved in operations where we can help to shed blood or keep the tools for Dr. Bshaft , ” explains O 'Malley .	-7.1418
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.2655
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon and often bring donated medical material .	-4.6539
However , if you are in Yaoundé first , Bwelle will take care of accommodation , transport and instruction .	-5.3495
" He is undoubtedly a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.0804
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no bounds .	-3.2055
For Bshaft , almost constant work is not a burden .	-3.8744
Helping others to live a happier life , and thereby fulfilling a promise he made to his father , gives him great pleasure .	-5.8917
“ I am so happy to do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-3.2373
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.1379
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.4070
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.3918

Getting the Fight Right	-2.5131
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , is edited by Horst Janson .	-3.4527
Janson himself is an old hand in his profession of acting .	-2.9791
No one can fool the old man Santiago in fishing .	-3.5254
So the two simply complement each other very well .	-7.4064
You almost think you can see the folds in the neck of the old man , which the fisherman boy Manolo talks about .	-5.9690
If Santiago is sick of life sitting on the chair , it is true with Janson .	-6.8808
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson performs excellently .	-4.9966
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and who ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his will .	-4.5052
Janson is one of the most famous actors on stage .	-6.5835
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on himself , so his monologues are not boring .	-4.2044
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the spectators forget that the sea is made up of blue water bottles .	-8.7505
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act on the boat in front of the fishing village .	-6.7041
In the course of the performance , he highlights the active scene : the Santiago Hut , the bar of singer Marie-Luise Favor , who , with her songs and her magnificent voice , enjoyed Cuba ’ s sense of life .	-10.3937
The four musicians play Cuban rhythms and are at the same time guests of the bar .	-3.0953
Tourism : Descent to the Romans	-2.8130
A Roman sewerage canal is preserved below Cologne .	-5.2255
If you visit Cologne , you won 't miss the cathedral .	-4.4806
The two towers rise up to the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-4.5626
But few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers know that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-6.0390
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne 's underworld .	-3.1648
Meeting point for his tours is the service center of Köln-Tourism directly at the Dom .	-3.6428
The tour starts very unspectacular : " We start in the underground car park , " says Schulze .	-6.2161
In the seventies , the city fathers wanted a city that was just for the car , and therefore , from the remains of the old city wall , there was only that which was not too big .	-9.2648
For this reason , most of the users of the Park House are rushing past the Roman ruins and only leaving their car .	-8.4648
But if you look more closely , you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal ants in the park deck D2 .	-5.7875
You can see about five meter high ruins of handmade stones .	-5.9618
" They are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century A.D. " , says Schulze .	-4.1836
Before going back to the daylight , Schulze lets participants on the upper level take a look at a dark , 15 m deep pit .	-6.7938
This is the well of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly noticed .	-5.1891
Next stop of the round is the Praetoria , and here the participants descend back into the deep .	-6.6677
We see here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the head of the CCAA .	-3.9142
What CCAA means is that a visitor wants to know .	-2.4463
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which in good German means " City of Roman Law and City of Agrippinenser , founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the Altar for the Imperial kult " .	-10.7787
And the Praetorian is the former Governor 's Palace , the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-4.1522
From the entrance hall of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman waste water channel , which is preserved here at about 120 metres in length .	-7.3972
" You can quietly walk along the so called Cloaca Maxima if you want " , Schulze cheers the guests .	-5.7323
One surprise is still Schulze .	-3.6280
After getting the key at the box office he leads the group to a 16-metre deep , walkable pit .	-6.2255
" We are now in Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.7819
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .	-4.6390
Until today , the lower end of the river Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , can be discerned by varying levels of the Rhine .	-5.5978
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square , for which the construction work will soon begin .	-5.0763
But it will take a few years to complete it .	-4.2970
Almost Abandoned Beige : Redemption of Rocke	-6.3068
A bloody attack in Rockermaeu is being rolled up after more than four years .	-4.8191
A trial for attempted manslaughter , dangerous bodily injury and damage to property for two 30-year-olds has begun at the District Court of Frankfurt ( Oder ) .	-5.4911
It is accompanied by strict safeguards .	-2.1792

According to the indictment , it was about infighting and a demonstration of power .	-3.8837

The Imagination Society Does Not Think	-4.4562
The night was long , the music was loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .	-2.8694
Only : in the trees of the people on the front-passenger seat and back seat , hunger is noticeable .	-5.4542
Of course , some cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this !	-4.9538

I admit I am happy to be with you when it comes to fast-food getting late at night or early morning .	-6.5237
A few chips , a cola , a burger - and then nothing like home and bed !	-4.8631
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco geese are noticeable .	-4.8697
Because what is missing is the fact that you regularly throw your fast-food bags out of the car window ?	-6.1550
On weekends in particular , paper bags are thrown away at street edges and in parking spaces .	-6.1153
" Why ? " I wonder .	-3.7664
Are people too willing to take the bags home or to the next trash bin ?	-4.8761
It is not just that the paper is scaring the landscape .	-4.6152
Tbags have also concealed transport facilities such as control panels , causing accidents .	-6.8998
But what does this " throw-away society " think about , it probably doesn 't even know what this word actually means .	-5.9085
If you are travelling more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know what a back seat can look like after nights spent : clothes , bottles and other rubbish are piled up .	-8.1718
There would be a few bags more or less of nothing - in contrast to the road , where nobody wants to trample on the food of others .	-7.9818
I can already see the day when the cities and municipalities are going to be blöd - and the fast-food chains are going to have to demand a deposit for their bags .	-10.8826
Obama ’ s Health Sentiment	-3.8369
After intense criticism , President Obama backed back yesterday ’ s often-repeated , unequivocal promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-8.2115
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of resignation , the Republicans have in recent days accused the president of deceiving the American public .	-7.8476
Yesterday , Obama put his initial promise into perspective .	-1.9831
“ The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.2454
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals , Obama called on those Americans who received such messages to look around the free market for new insurance .	-4.5403
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or at a lower price than predicted .	-4.7036
“ You are getting a better deal , ” he said .	-3.2034
The government described it as little surprising that the five percent of the population who have taken insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-6.6178
“ I want to say to these Americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” Sebelius said at a hearing in the House ’ s Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .	-4.3092
Sebelius , who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , explained that the start of the online platform has been “ abysmal ” since October .	-3.9367
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-2.1315
I am determined to regain your trust .	-1.4144
This statement by an angry Sebelius to be an adviser behind her at yesterday ’ s hearing in the House of Representatives was received after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri , asking whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare .	-7.3900
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly challenged the question why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily dispense with government-sponsored insurance to pay a fee to HealthCare.gov , which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans .	-6.5612
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force bases	-3.9632
On Thursday , an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to the US news channel CNN that Israeli fighter planes had attacked a Syrian Latakia air base a day earlier .	-5.0406
The goal was " missiles and related equipment " , which the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-4.9475
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya , previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled on Thursday night , and that the Israelis were held responsible for it .	-5.7208
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia on which Russian S-125 Newa defence missiles and a SA-3 battery of missiles , which , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads of up to 70 kilograms .	-15.7639
Unsure The Jerusalem Government has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.4627
However , the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official saying that he believes Israel has carried out the attack , but is not sure .	-5.1257
In any case , one spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.9036
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that the Syrian regime had already tried to supply ground-air missiles to Hezbollah earlier , partly successfully .	-5.2715
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a ' red line ' which would be followed by a military response .	-3.6754
John Kerry , in an unprecedented admission that the US espionage has “ gone too far . ”	-3.9022
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , hinted at a softening of the US ’ s defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that the espionage had “ gone too far ” in certain cases .	-7.0357
The foreign minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for “ autopilot , ” when Whistleblower ’ s explosive revelations about NSA espionage became public .	-4.6817
The leaked information has led the US government to a diplomatic storm of outrage on the part of its allies .	-3.1516
Speaking via video at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said , “ There is no question that the President and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have almost been done by autopilot simply because the ability to do so was what happened to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War , and , of course , to September 11 . ”	-7.7950
He then admitted as the first senior member of the US government that the US espionage had crossed a limit , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-4.6507
He said , ‘ In some cases , this has gone too far . ’	-3.9724
The President is determined to provide clarity and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place .	-5.6474
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process .	-2.2374
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good , and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations .	-4.0739
He added , “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up . ”	-2.9984
There is a radical extremism in the world that is bent on killing people , blowing in the air and attacking governments .	-4.2220
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens ?	-3.5961
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learned of such plans in advance .	-4.9144
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorism efforts , as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday .	-4.9736
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organisations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency 's monitoring .	-5.3152
“ It is very important for the national security interests of the US that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who is first in the Senate as a Democrat and is the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-6.0874
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.8599
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies , even though the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.4801
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden that the NSA had monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone and up to 34 other world leaders .	-4.9655
The head of the national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides .	-4.5846
In all this tumult , Murphy said that his authority was preparing the visit of the Congress to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .	-11.0427
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-3.1056
He said that the exact itinerary is still being prepared .	-3.6335
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.6104
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they themselves have been using for years .	-3.5844
“ While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect Europeans ’ rights , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , ” Murphy said .	-4.8618
Meanwhile , a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland is scheduled for John Kerry to address the resentment over US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities es es es es .	-6.2904

Australian Penalty in Thailand	-3.1335
A 21-year-old Sydney woman , sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver , appealed against the sentence and was released on bail .	-3.7484
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false statement after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning on Sunday 10 June , while two other men detained her .	-5.8595
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend .	-4.8050
The police in Phuket conducted Bamford for two days until they thought the story .	-5.0042
Until the trial , it was in police custody on the	-5.3688
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phukets , instead of in a prison for adult women .	-6.5118
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League , who contacted the Foreign Ministry in Canberra for help for his daughter .	-4.7290
Tung told Sydney ’ s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “ extremely worried ” about his daughter ’ s welfare and wanted her back in Australia .	-4.1578
“ We are of course very concerned , but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tung .	-4.3438
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is at liberty against a deposit of 50,000 Baht .	-5.0817
In Australian reports , she has been on holiday in the meantime in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand .	-4.6897
The court ’ s testimony was that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket , and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison .	-6.1547
However , it is also possible that Thailand , following the recent murder of the travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket , might try to improve its battered tourist image , and therefore face a acquittal .	-7.7079
