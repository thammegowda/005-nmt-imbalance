Munich 1856 : Four Cards Changing Your Look at the City	-2.7375
An insane institution where young people are supposed to meet today .	-4.0868
A pit chapel , now excavated for the S-Bahn ( city rail ) tunnel .	-4.5192
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers .	-3.0496
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-3.5665
It is annoying if maps are not up to date .	-3.2820
Everyone knows that , because the car Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-5.7571
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-atlas , an offer by the GeoPortal Bavaria of the state government , are far from current - but this is precisely why they are very revealing .	-7.3965
Especially when you compare them with current online maps .	-3.1683
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of Munich ’ s Merkur since the 19th century .	-4.1794
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork quilt that you don 't immediately recognize as such .	-5.0229
More detailed maps for cities and municipalities have been included in the large map .	-5.0734
These were created according to data from the Bavarian surveying authority between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .	-6.1493
Your client : Napoleon .	-2.3647
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-3.6731
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - for military purposes , of course .	-4.2770
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of February 9 , 1801 , it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map .	-5.6107
Elector Max IV pushed the project forward , founded the " Topographical Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration .	-5.4777
The Munich Urpositsblatt is from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .	-5.7497
The comparison used in the past / present is most impressive at the example of the state capital .	-5.1152
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-2.6816
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.3643
Sendling was incorporated in Munich in 1877 , 21 years after the map was created .	-5.0332
Today Untersendling lies in the heart of the city .	-3.1746
The Untersendling houses are concentrated around 1856 along today ’ s Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plingenser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasant revolt against Austria in 1705 .	-5.6895
Where the Western Park is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zooming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand-numbered flurpieces from the so-called " Uraufnahme " from which the land tax was derived .	-7.0621
Today , small plots no longer occupy farmers - but small gardeners of the " Land in Sun " facility .	-6.0579
A large green area lies north of Untersendling .	-5.1161
The Theresienwiese , the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .	-4.5380
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.9292
In the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen you can read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " Auf der Lüften " - but also in large letters " Crazy Anstalt " .	-5.9065
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e you once blocked people with delusions .	-4.8261
In 1858 / 59 the Munich district of Irnanstadt " Auf der Auer Lüften " was created .	-6.1058
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden directed the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-5.5176
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the arrival of the so-called madmen .	-4.7466
In addition , he has banned personnel from using force against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen Museum , who worked with the institution for an exhibition .	-5.4795
280 patients had first had room , and later was extended to 500 places .	-5.6689
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the perineuns in hair 1905 .	-6.5058
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amp-Klinikum München-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatry , has been located there .	-5.1269
Young people are now meeting at the former Auer Anstalt in the Munich Salesianum .	-4.8411
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational facilities .	-4.0521
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .	-4.0443
In 2015 the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built , in architectural terms , on the basis of the original building of the insane age , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks .	-8.1610
The Marienplatz square was named " Hauptplatz " around 1856 , and the Kaufingerstra<unk>e was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.6959
The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-3.6718
In December 1944 , Allied bombs ripped many holes into the city centre .	-4.4416
A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof .	-3.4524
The English Institute , small business houses and a medieval mining chapel were once at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work took place and the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn ( city rail ) line on April 5 , 2017 .	-7.3316
The slider lets you compare the old Munich map with the current aerial photo - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.6167
Citizens ' Rights Group Published Travel Warning for Missouri	-2.4583
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons issued a warning to people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-5.7167
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travelers , visitors , and non-tourists to pay particular attention when traveling through the state and to exercise extreme caution , as a series of questionable , racist incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are recorded here , " said the group 's opinion .	-7.8981
A recent law passed by Missouri , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , and state law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities , led the group to issue the travel warning , said NAACP .	-5.1637
" They have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.8880
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten up or killed , " said the president of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.1712
'We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not heard yet ' .	-3.5078
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.7166
The group cited incidents such as racial offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.7370
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol while travelling through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-5.0786
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General ’ s Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 % more likely to be detained than whites .	-5.5908
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends , and employees about what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-3.5988
" People must be prepared to accept bail or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-5.4943
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate criminal reporting program , which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such injuries .	-3.9802
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-3.6882
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after immigration laws had been passed , forcing local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations , which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.6199
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-4.1093
The White Light Project is Essential	-4.4373
The Fischerbacher Weidezaune project is a success project and will continue next year .	-3.7662
The CDU members Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac presented themselves on the spot .	-4.8662
At the Rechtsgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two parliamentarians .	-5.3761
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm , where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.6104
According to Schwendemann , " black forest milk " is for him an alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows .	-4.5226
On the table of the holiday guests only regional .	-5.8620
Since he is also Chairman of the BLHV of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaunproject " vitally important " .	-5.6873
I cannot be profitable on such steep lands .	-3.9108
The green area ensures a lot of work , a lot of work has to be done with Motorsense .	-7.8545
" We are struggling with conditions and topography here , " said Schwendemann .	-3.1706
In 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not run a biological farm .	-5.8927
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality has recognised the importance of the Weidezauna project and is pleased with the leadership promotion " .	-6.5965
At the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare , farmers should be supported .	-3.3449
It is hoped that this could extend the afforestation of land for a while .	-4.6934
" The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to carry on their business , " said the mayor .	-4.9560
Farmers are often criticised for their support .	-2.9079
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in via the grazing aids .	-4.8207
The open area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be planted until at least 2023 .	-5.7649
Of the total costs of 71 500 euros , half were supported by the leader , and a quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischenbach .	-6.0154
The farmers therefore remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture .	-4.5243
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences , " said Schwendemann .	-1.9311
Kordula Kovac said : ' You are doing a good job without farmers and housewives ' .	-4.5045
Peter Wei<unk> also stated : " Here the best food is produced " .	-4.0008
The Landschaft Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg provides for the state funding of pasture buildings .	-6.1658
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.6184
A prerequisite is the existence of a support framework designated by the LPR .	-5.4702
In addition , the fenced-in area must not be sustainable ( slope slope over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-6.2316
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the application is being made by eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .	-6.7615
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are over 112 000 euros .	-4.9422
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.7728
Now Trump ’ s White House takes the Statue of Liberty	-3.2945
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-2.2015
The Americans appreciate this , as do any other – hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-5.5268
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he did when he adopted a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration .	-4.2699
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue himself .	-2.3667
A Horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-2.9078
But it took on its significance , and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the monument was completed .	-5.6665
As Miller Acosta exclaimed : " I don 't want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world .	-5.0408
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-3.1495
Miller is factually correct , but as he put it himself , it is not really about history .	-2.8271
It is about the contemporary response to Lazarus 's stirring words , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your idlings , your poor , / your beleaguered masses who yearn for free breathing / the miserable waste of your coasts ' .	-7.1008
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " on our screens was better seen .	-4.0890
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6469
This conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America .	-3.9405
Lazarus - and their friends , who used to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act .	-5.4755
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn out classical pictorial representation .	-6.3989
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-3.1994
And it gives itself a very different name : the mother of the exiles .	-4.6141
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.4986
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .	-3.5879
The great scream of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for Trump ’ s coming , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative who brought the American flame to the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is advancing .	-5.7745
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.0988
The torch should not lead the way to the United States . '	-2.7259
It 's quite unusual that Limbaugh came across something here .	-6.7488
The importance of the statue is a question of the position of perception .	-3.8823
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-4.6273
It is literally a matter of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.8641
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.7629
And that , of course , is not the prospect that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize .	-3.5408
Their torch is not meant to enlighten the way , but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power .	-3.9862
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team .	-2.5020
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team .	-2.4301
The UK ’ s director of athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish contingent on the World Cup will " make a massive contribution to the team " .	-5.7859
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.1064
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and that the United Kingdom 's athletics needs to learn something from it .	-4.6406
" We welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , " Black said .	-2.7791
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.6330
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.4405
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-1.9030
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.5400
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.6949
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal winners , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete with Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit , while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as team captain by the team .	-5.8553
" Eilidh is rather modest .	-1.3851
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " Black says .	-2.6735
" A number of athletes , regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-3.3421
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great . '	-5.4395
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner , who will compete in the 400 m hurdles at their fifth World Championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-6.1959
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes in the World Cup was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.9255
Last year , the medium-haul skier , Mr Muir , set five British and two European records .	-4.8002
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-2.7202
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot to watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-5.3994
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was .	-3.6931
The team captain says that she is " immensely proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team , but in some cases will also be involved in medals and finals .	-5.3658
" The special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team mates voted for me and elected me , makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-5.6491
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.5080
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.9238
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on podiums .	-3.1270
As regards my speech as a captain ?	-3.2960
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.1539
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , because we have a home world championship .	-3.5432
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.0269
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.6932
Block critics on Facebook : Don ’ t worry about public office if you can ’ t cope with voter heating .	-5.4520
The father of our country knew something of a bad press .	-2.4694
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to political principles .	-3.0783
He certainly shied at the criticism .	-4.0327
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.1725
In 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dumb , we are led to slaughter like sheep ' .	-4.4217
This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan , Maryland , who must work to be more like Washington .	-5.3197
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-5.3305
The American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him earlier this week .	-2.3436
The staff of the governor dismissed the suit as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Well , and ? " .	-3.0372
" It 's just Facebook , " many people said .	-1.6511
But it is important .	-0.8963
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.6075
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular .	-2.6781
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.2685
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead .	-1.0740
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to the principles .	-3.3235
He was also very adept at using Facebook as the primary means of connecting to his constituents and playing his hairless head for chemotherapy on his side .	-5.4015
Therefore , blocking people who come on the board of the governor - which is a public forum called official and paid by public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-6.1323
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesperson , Amelia Chasse , defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation .	-3.9813
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls , spammers , or hate-filled people waving the stick online .	-4.5307
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-2.1463
And these are only real people speaking to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , a priest , no trolls .	-3.6974
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , and not profound .	-2.3927
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to the Catholic beliefs of the hooligans .	-5.3936
lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , MP . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .	-5.2080
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the news program " The Post " .	-3.7176
" I do not appreciate this idea , either , when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some do not regard it as a so-called collective commitment and do not recognise it as a large group of citizens affected " .	-7.7939
What the governor 's staff called a " concentrated spam attack " would probably be called " advocacy " by others .	-4.5148
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.7381
It is much cleaner than in the past if we had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials , or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-4.6719
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-2.4568
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.5881
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.9338
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-2.8587
The chairman of Loudoun County ’ s Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to US Chief Justice James C. Cacheeris in Alexandria , when they expelled a voter from their Facebook page .	-5.0395
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-1.9326
That should not be so difficult .	-2.0007
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable postage had a similar effect as the Internet .	-2.5930
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letterwriters appealed to his leadership .	-3.4803
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.2022
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .	-4.4143
Petitions criticizing his position on the treaty of Amity , trade , and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .	-4.1565
But he did not silence them .	-1.6381
Free speech , disagreement , and discourses form the basis of our nation .	-2.9276
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.6726
Ronan Raffaty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club	-5.4451
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-4.4034

Gary Orr , who came earlier this year for the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday , returns to the action on home soil .	-4.5837
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-2.3368
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.6708
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .	-2.7480
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-1.9746
I am pleased about the way things have gone . '	-4.3125
With the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty .	-3.2242

Reduced lung cancer deaths from passive smoking	-2.6964
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.7310
Scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) have achieved this result in a study .	-5.0761
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to passive smoking , " said Head of study Heiko Becher .	-3.5224
By comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue in 1994 .	-7.6525
At that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .	-6.4208
The new research is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.2672
Connecting home turns out to be very complex .	-3.2014
The construction of the Villinger Stra<unk>e is in full swing and is " reasonably in time " , according to the head of the Fred Heinze building house .	-6.2944
In the area of the domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .	-7.8251
The traffic , which constantly hinders the construction work , is a major problem for the Stumpp building block .	-6.3611
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and shut-off gates is enormous , " says Heinze .	-4.7161
The road was closed and only the buses were allowed to pass through .	-5.6289

It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces through a public hand-picking .	-6.0190
An existing movement that sought independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta , which maintains control of the region , excluding foreign journalists or right-wing observers .	-5.0212
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island .	-4.9732

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of Asia ’ s worst infant mortality and literacy rates .	-3.1407
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold land .	-2.9862
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-4.5601
In 2015 alone , Freeport has cut $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-3.6161
In addition , Papua has an estimated $ 78 billion in wood resources .	-2.9035
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence .	-3.7301
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.8065

The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua 's 29 districts , including Paniai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.6993
But little has changed in Papua , and today locals feel cheated .	-2.9847
" Our hearts have been broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-3.5453
In fact , only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October , Paniai suffered a low point .	-3.0171
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-4.3024
The frightened children told them that they should turn on their headlights .	-2.8769
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-5.5337
The soldiers who had drunk drove and beat the group with their rifles , said victims and witnesses .	-3.6356
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.4783
A child aged 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo was beaten so hard that he fell into coma .	-3.2837
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire , and things escalated the next day .	-2.9904
About 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .	-3.3838
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird 's song - of Papuas Mee Pago tribe .	-6.1716
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts .	-2.7103
When the mood was heated up , the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " says TIME 's official document , which was not released to the local media .	-5.7065
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Congo district of Enarotali , saw the imminent danger and called for rest and demanded the crowd to return home .	-9.8502
Nobody was in the mood to listen .	-1.5224
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-3.7359
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .	-2.9338
" It was crowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-1.6104
The indigenous man Alfius Youw was met three times , according to his cousin , who witnessed the shootings .	-3.8275
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesians , has only one name , TIME in a gloomy mood .	-4.9395
" I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . "	-2.0212
The chief inspector of the Papua Police , Yotje Mende , told reporters that his officers only wanted to " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-3.8110
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " said the spokesperson of the Papua police , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-3.8407
'It is about life and death ' .	-1.7529
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured .	-2.1652
The news of the killings only came to Jakarta the following day ' filtered ' .	-3.2482
Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi made a passionate speech expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua .	-4.7441
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-3.1938
In October 2016 , security minister Wiranto said that he was setting up an extra-judicial mechanism for settling historical human rights violations .	-5.4400
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.6914
" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-1.6368
Some were in the 90 's and early 2000 's .	-2.8283
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that must be gone through , " he said .	-3.5494
Then , when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June , Wiredu made a retreat , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-4.2305
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-1.7491
Wiredu , accused by the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody 1999 independence vote , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled , including the Paniai incident .	-4.6459
Families of the Paniai victims received such allegations with grim disbelief .	-7.6034
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.7899
'I am tired ' .	-1.1239
He says that years later he still lives in fear .	-1.6674
" I 'm afraid , " he says .	-1.2964
" I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid of being shot . "	-4.5899
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-3.2865
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.5521
" After I had buried the corpses , the military looked for me , " he says .	-3.2771
The shootings have not stopped .	-1.8110
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighbourhood Deiyai .	-3.7878
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-8.1977
The man , 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who was drowned while fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to hospital .	-3.1280
Fixed villagers protested in front of the company ’ s location office .	-3.7014
The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.3558
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) started shooting the crowd and killed one .	-3.0163
" We were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , according to TIME .	-5.5978
'I have been hiding in my house for two days ' .	-3.1638
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be called to account and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area .	-4.1763
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian Government .	-2.5317
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribe of Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal , who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.4164
Many joined the Free Papua Movement ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-2.8940
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-3.0119
In response , thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained under the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-2.9112
Some never appear again .	-1.6499
Paniai is known as a " tragic , forgotten place " among the people of Papua .	-3.7289
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.6114
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-3.1328
Bread is just as out of reach .	-1.9341
The people here build up everything they eat : especially Nota and fruit and vegetables .	-6.2878
Agriculture is the job of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .	-4.0971
They keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.5738
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-2.4372
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport .	-5.0192
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better-educated and wealthier migrants .	-3.2296
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills needed to lead its own companies in a competitive or fashion or or .	-6.8082
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai tribe .	-3.5076
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.4136
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain strained for international media .	-3.1625
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-4.2649
According to Phelim Kine , Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowi ’ s campaign promises to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-4.3749
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.7285
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbors of Papuas .	-3.7764
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the " various and widespread injuries " in Papua , including the Paniai shootings .	-3.5145
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-2.2160
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is free media so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-5.3717
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-2.4087
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar , Jayapura , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and forced him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-5.2286
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua is unlikely to vote again for Jokowi .	-2.8103
" Jokowi is a man with good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-4.5404
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor educational and health services .	-3.7565
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must repay .	-3.8676
" They don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.2029
Despite the threats and intimidation , families of the Paniai shooting victims performed a last symbolic act of comfort : the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .	-5.5848
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.4515
" One member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with a lowered head .	-2.9936
'What else can we do ? '	-1.1243
Fire capture Dubai 's ' Torch ' skyscraper for the second time .	-2.4785
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high , 79-storey building .	-4.2646
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise in just two years , which by chance is called the Torch Tower .	-5.1597
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.5111
" We slept and we stood up in the fire alarm and shouting people .	-4.2741
We ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " a resident who told his name as George angab , Reuters .	-4.3799
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that anti-fire units extinguished the fire and cooled the building at 4.00 p.m. local time ( midnight GMT ) .	-4.7194
The government said it is working to provide shelter for those affected .	-2.5804
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outside areas of high-rise buildings around the world .	-3.7318
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the covering , the outer covering , the decoration or isolation .	-6.7449
In the United Kingdom , the police said that they believe that the system of panels for isolating and covering the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died .	-5.5575
No David Cup reform : Next Best of five .	-2.7570
The president of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has passed through the General Assembly with his big Davis-Cup Coup .	-7.5554
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup singles on only two sets of wins was hardly supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-7.2664
The five-string classic , which is often very long , but which is also highly appreciated for this reason , is thus retained by the traditional competition .	-7.5670
63.54 % of the member states voted for the reform , so the target of ITTF President David Haggerty was barely missed .	-4.1762
" We respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-3.0051
We need a change to secure the long-term future of this iconic and historic contest , " said Haggerty .	-2.6198
They will continue to work to improve the competition .	-2.7365
Not until the vote had been taken , after many objections , the proposal had already been made to carry the final out in a neutral place .	-6.6993
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host rights in the first round in the following year .	-5.7604
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers , the requirements for training places etc will be made easier , and players will have to make less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-6.4898
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items into the plane , finds a poll .	-5.1153
A survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously banned items are smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades .	-5.8779
Less than 1 % claimed that they had belatedly discovered that they had mistakenly traveled with guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.1778
The survey of more than 1,000 people conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc . , a jet charter service , also found that younger travelers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.9293
Of those surveyed who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were millennials , compared to less than 15 % that were members of the X generation .	-5.1848
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.1821
More than 3 % admitted that they knowingly carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also acknowledged that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .	-5.4363
The company said that it consulted travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods would have brought through airport security and how many would have done so deliberately .	-5.6269
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggled goods through safety - knowingly or unwittingly - were those who fly most frequently .	-5.3020
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.8461
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-4.2937
So it is no surprise that the largest number of items seized by TSA are prohibited liquids .	-3.7367
For a while , people thought that TSA could see books as a contraband .	-4.0882
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-2.2260
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order .	-1.9110
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to give with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-4.4382
In doing so , he has denied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their no-obligation reservations .	-8.7261
In addition to the consistently triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed another , less brilliant figure : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-7.5178
Musk has often advertised over the past few months with more than 500,000 preorders for the new car , which is now being delivered .	-6.0854
Now Musk admits : Of the 518,000 pre-orders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-3.7064
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.5783
In case of cancellation , Tesla will refund the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK $ 1000 ) " reservation deposit " .	-6.1658
Currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations were made , Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .	-4.0223
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of approximately twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .	-5.0486
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.6125
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.0446
2018 - all models put together - is expected to be 500,000 , and by 2020 a million .	-4.7536
The demand is obviously there .	-2.7880
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-2.6625
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without major interruptions with maximum capacity . the , , , or , or . , or .	-10.1478
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.7602
However , if there are more delays , the non-availability of reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-5.2100
After all , the company cannot prevent disaffected customers from running away in droves .	-6.2234
EPO ’ s chief executive , Pruitt , is withdrawing from the Obama Era ’ s rules on emissions reduction .	-6.3131
One day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency , took back his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of smog caused air pollutants .	-4.8529
Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.9185
He did not mention the action that had been taken against his previous post in a federal court of appeal .	-4.2557
It is a deadline for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.1760
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth " .	-4.3526
Pruitt , who was a public prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump , was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time .	-4.8526
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly resorted to blocking or delaying regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry oppose .	-3.7730
Wednesday ’ s sudden reversal is the recent legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.6833
Last month , a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority by trying to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that committed oil and gas companies to control and reduce methane leaks .	-8.5326
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforce CEPOL ’ s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-4.3022
" Under previous administrations , CEPOL has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued CEPOL more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.9106
" We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.7246
We are also taking the law and the authority that exists . '	-6.4263
Nevertheless , CEPOL 's opinion said that at some point Pruitt will use its ' delayed power and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are ' based on sound policies and the best available information ' .	-5.4751
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a more comprehensive overhaul of ozone rules .	-3.0321
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.1587
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.4246
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.7088
" The reversal of CEPOL - after our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.7637
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-2.4776
Soil ozone occurs when harmful substances from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .	-2.8266
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive groups of people , and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-5.4136
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered for Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-2.7404
" It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to obtain this sensible step from the air protection officer we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-4.6333
" We must continue to fight against the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their particular interests . "	-3.1538
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church	-2.0810
750 years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche , the old Friedhof area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.30 p.m.	-5.1819
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-4.4067
The visitors of the sixth charity reunion can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-5.7512
The friends and supporters of Tumlinger have made it their concern to save and preserve the oldest building in the village .	-5.0011
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village gem " .	-2.7521
In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in a document in the Württembergischen Urkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .	-5.6711
In addition to the former parish church , there was also a stately court on the Tumlinger Berg , to which the church or the law of patronage belonged and not the other way around .	-7.5013
So people also lived there .	-3.2385
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the picture of the town of Tumlingen , the " mountain " was the third , the stately settlement core of the village .	-7.2668
Old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical realities .	-4.4201
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval right of the church .	-5.5482
A gentleman who built a church , equipped it and occupied it with a priest remained the owner of this church and could inherit this church .	-6.6498
The right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop was associated with this .	-4.8794
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.0623
The larger ones of the two died at Christmas 1673 .	-3.8078
The new bell sounded in 1692 , but had to be released later in World War II in 1942 .	-5.3218
In the Thirty Years ' War ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were closed and the bells were stolen .	-4.4505
The roof was leaking .	-2.1896
In 1796 , French troops were stationed near the church .	-2.2552
They broke out the pulpits and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.6234
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-2.8536
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead of the Hörschweiler .	-5.9182
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church was abandoned .	-3.8956
Only the church tower was left standing .	-3.6529
In New Year ’ s Eve 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .	-4.3699
To avoid disaster , the tower was abandoned .	-3.7874
Only the existing tower dwarg was preserved as a witness to 750 years of church history .	-5.1104
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the " Schaffhausen pensioners " as successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant .	-5.5468
On Sunday , 16 July , the Friends and Patrons of Tumlingens invite to the 6th Serenade in the old cemetery of the St. Hilarius Chapel .	-6.5218
It is designed by the Combo of the Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-4.9125
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-3.7058
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.6054
Admission is from 3.30pm onwards .	-4.1066
As the Serenade draws to a close , a raid will take place in front of the graveyard .	-4.8456
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows and towards the forest " , the organizers reveal the fantastic view .	-5.6062
The Serenade only takes place in dry weather .	-2.5553
The organisers hope for many supporters for the conservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant , which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler .	-6.5232
The friends and supporters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms .	-5.2776
Association wants to have the approval of wind turbines checked .	-5.4543
'Boisheim defends itself ' does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat .	-5.9099
The association " Boisheim defends itself " has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines at the Boisheim Nette .	-6.0514
It was unlawful .	-2.0916
The association argues that , at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheim Nette , because at that time , only a wind concentration zone existed in Viersen on the city ’ s border with Schwalmtal .	-6.5495
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exploitation of wind power for the rest of the city .	-6.0492
Such zones are designed to prevent the landscape from being " sealed " .  .	-6.5610
The city of Viersen had decided a second concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette by modifying the land use plan a few days earlier - but this was not approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form error .	-7.7277
" Due to the lack of a planning legal requirement , the approved approval certificate is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn , " said Christoph Ergens , Chairman of " Boisheim " .	-7.1159
Current state of affairs : before the summer break , the town council has again decided on the wind concentration zone in Boisheim Nette ; approval from the district government is still pending .	-6.2499
In this case , the granting of a licence for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded .	-7.7482
The circle confirms the receipt of the call .	-1.6866
" The corresponding letters have been received by District Viersen since last week , " said a speaker .	-5.1444
The circle is taking the opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-4.5965
However , they are unlikely to stop the process .	-4.1608
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court , the district did not want to comment on the content of the reasoning of the association " Boisheim defends itself " on Thursday .	-6.6885
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four 200 meter high wind turbines on an area at Boisheim Nette .	-5.1308
Last year , the company , in which the town of Viersen is indirectly involved , had already concluded leases with the owner of the approx . 65 hectares of land .	-5.6404
The four wind turbines are designed to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households – that is , about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .	-6.5096
NEW Re wants to invest about EUR 20 million .	-2.7295
Last summer , Viersen ’ s City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen , as well as an investment in a wind turbine in Prakach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg .	-5.6585
Car and tractor scraps together : woman dies in terrible accidents	-10.1104
A terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel ( Rhine-Lahn circle ) .	-4.3607
A woman was fatally injured .	-2.1633
Two other people were slightly injured .	-2.1393
The provincial road remained closed for hours .	-2.8982
According to police data , a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich , with her car , took the L 333 towards Bogel as an escort for her 53-year-old mother .	-7.0389
City and Dealers are planning " Home Shoppers " weekend	-8.0304
Bad Langensalzburg and people from the region are expected to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September .	-4.0871
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the inhabitants to go shopping in the city centre .	-6.1322
As the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the " Heimatschappen " weekend is intended to raise awareness among customers about what the city has to offer outside the usual supermarket goods .	-8.3048
A market with regional providers is therefore planned , similar to the weekly market .	-4.2454
In addition , local companies are expected to present themselves with their training places .	-4.8334
In addition , the shops in the city centre are supposed to invite you to " midnight shopping " .	-5.7601
The campaign is aimed not only at residents of the city and the region .	-4.8843
In preparation are commercials on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , according to Christian König .	-4.3539
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-3.4423
The commercial association and the city are entering another stage of the project " Attractive city centre " .	-5.3272
These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " of the Brunnenfest including an open Sunday , discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-5.7090
Also attractive Saturday offers and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .	-3.9749
In addition , customer potential is to be newly or re-developed .	-4.2255
These include spa guests and tourists .	-2.1717
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre when shopping .	-6.2212
In the end , everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - to landlords , to businesses throughout the city and to    .	-7.0795
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network , which partly spread , king said in the spring .	-4.7625
Birgit Strech , Head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , announced that five cities will participate for the first time on the third " home shop " day nationwide .	-5.9194
In addition to Bad Langensalzburg these are Weimar , Säterda , Heiligenstadt and Bleucherbode .	-5.0420
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities ' , says Streck .	-5.6472
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his / her buying behavior can influence his / her own direct environment .	-5.4527
Two dead and several injured after an explosion at US school	-5.1803
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .	-2.7955
New people were injured .	-1.3148
A gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis killed two people and injured nine more , some of them severely .	-2.9979
According to the fire department , on Wednesday ( local time ) an injured person was still in critical condition .	-4.8647
One person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion .	-3.0864
An initially missing child was also born later .	-4.9404
The dead were school employees .	-1.7139
As an accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .	-2.8257
During the holiday period , few people stayed in the Minehaha Academy building .	-5.3769
Trump , after leaked transcripts of telephone calls , put Mexico under pressure for paying the border wall .	-4.1245
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were published by the Washington Post .	-4.6788
On January 27 , Trump called in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.1652
The US President insulted him because he publicly denounced the wall , and he reportedly said to him : ' You cannot tell the press that ' .	-5.3332
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise of building a wall on the US southern border , and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.3923
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-3.3792
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that trading for the US is " ridiculous " , " mies " and " stupid " for refugees who emigrated to Australia , and that insisting on the trade that the Obama administration has mediated would make him look like a " depp " after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-6.3495
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr Turnbull that ' this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.1252
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists Revive Racism ’ s Lynchaff as a Justice Call	-5.9786
A 1940s Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and caught up on the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-3.8858
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with guns to block his way .	-3.0635
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield .	-4.5046
Inside , the inmates were floating in fear .	-4.4220
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " the man shouted .	-3.0837
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.8776
Cries torn the silence when a young black man was dragged from the front-passenger seat .	-3.5527
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a reprieve .	-4.4387
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost all of the audience cast very real sigh .	-4.6848
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.6353
No one has ever been charged with the murders .	-6.2878
" It is truly inconceivable that in all these years , not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities even though we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the reprinting .	-6.0080
" It is a stain on a history , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.8423
Brooks is a 71 year old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a long-time civil rights activist .	-4.7798
For him , reprinting serves as a dramatic call for action , and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.8869
" We want prosecution , we want the end , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , " he said .	-3.2002
'We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-3.2174
A forensic physician lays a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Lynchen on July 27 , 1946 .	-4.6614
According to FBI records received from NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of being involved in the lynching process .	-4.1963
But no one has ever been charged .	-2.0331
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-5.4260
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court decision made it possible for Georgia ’ s black citizens to vote for the first time in the presidential campaign in the summer .	-4.2369
About at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom pricked a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .	-4.3071
Brooks said that there was a rumour in the city that Hester had slept with Malcom 's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .	-5.0677
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to liberate Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-3.1389
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.5867
But when they moved from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-9.8448
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-3.1739
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses " .	-4.8437
Brooks puts it even more succinctly .	-4.3402
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.2219
'You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and vote , that will happen to you here . '	-8.5399
For nearly a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-2.7015
Their presentation is graphic , touching and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America .	-5.4464
It is hard to watch and even harder to look away , but Greene said that is the point .	-2.8355
" We don 't want to talk about the lynching , because we are then confronted with its ugly state in all of us , " she said .	-6.1288
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through " .	-3.7473
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks - rushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the play .	-4.8151
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes co-director here .	-1.6476
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said the role would never be easier .	-2.6534
" I feel dirty because I 'm not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.2549
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-3.2736
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rasona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.6456
The play begins with Malcom , who joins Hester and joins him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-5.9538
" I said n --- he , blurred of my property ! "	-3.2735
Rasona reciprocates the fire .	-2.4906
There is a break .	-1.1908
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.5474
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.4446
" What ? ! " , Rasona asked .	-2.0010
He is alarmed and confused .	-1.1142
Was I too harsh ?	-1.5190
" No " , Greene said , is still kissing .	-3.5340
" I simply do not believe that white people said ' n --- he ' at the time .	-5.6354
" But " one of the other black actors quipped .	-3.0155
" You only have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-2.7195
And that is where the energy shifts in the room , a feeling of comradeship replaces the discomfort .	-4.8899
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.0010
The scene begins again .	-1.6241
This time , when Rasona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-2.9655
Absolutely nobody laughs .	-2.3223
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-2.1929
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.5484
A woman dressed with a funeral dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays 's praises of " Strange Fruit " .	-5.9343
Your voice breaks with every second word .	-2.3937
About a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators slips sweat and tears out of the eyes .	-4.4479
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .	-2.5636
A couple came from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .	-3.5926
Each of them spent nearly eight hours of Georgia ’ s oppressive moisture when Brooks leads her to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorsey on a pilgrimage .	-7.2315
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the lynch murders took place , the air feels ghostly .	-5.9024
When the final notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse .	-4.2803
Children hoard at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other .	-3.2951
" They are not really dead , " a little boy mutates as if he wanted to remember .	-4.4386
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .	-2.7366
The actors throw away the lynchpart and wipe their tears .	-2.6850
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .	-2.3303
Nick Rasona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms crying , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .	-5.4986
" It 's okay " , whispers one of the women .	-1.4798
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.8941
You did so for one reason . '	-1.7149
Later , the audience met the actors for dinner .	-3.3097
At a table a white couple from Atlanta chats stimulated about the juxtaposition with a black couple they have just met .	-5.8462
Denise Dulinski fought to find words that left the performance feeling .	-3.2726
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you , " she said .	-3.3529
" What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynching continues , " she added , " today this is called only police speech . "	-6.0297
In the same room Tyrone Brooks 's court is holding at his table , eating and recalling civil rights .	-6.9564
He said he had already started planning next year 's performance .	-3.1775
" The reprinting is in some way inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.7426
" It 's so if we don 't learn anything from it , it can happen again .	-3.8970
Those who do not study their own history , those who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-3.2606
" Twilight of the Gods " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth .	-3.4453
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf insists on a varit-frivole staging in a gigantic , six-story setting .	-6.6281
The rotary stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) features a shabby street corner including the Berlin Wall and the Berlin wall , a " plastic and elaste " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-6.1514
Before that , an open Mercedes classic will park in which the Rheintöchter will pose as rockers , or alternatively an Isetta .	-6.5409
Reeved oil barrels recall Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - that draws through his " ring " staging .	-5.6880
The three Rheintöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiedibke Lehkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise as in the " Rheingold " .	-5.1846
They seduce Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , tear a body in the trunk in Hollywood style , and give the Krauble-Clique .	-6.1935
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully fevered hails surrounding the aura of a heavyweight boxer .	-3.4693
Brutal the scene when he shoots Siegfried .	-2.4672
Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must later believe in this .	-3.9605
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-1.8590
The festival is celebrated by Foster , Milling , Vinke and Conductor Janowski , who is modest and who embodies the hands of the Merkel-Raute in a formal fashion .	-10.4910
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which for the first time shows itself on stage - again in casual casual casual clothes in the face of the great heat .	-6.5052
Frank Castorf and his director team were eagerly awaited .	-3.0813
In 2013 , when he had to go through a gelling whistling concert , there was a great jubilation five years later , during which the single " Buh " -run was interrupted .	-9.5604
The festival director Katharina Wagner was probably happy with this .	-7.0400
" It is evident that the audience has in some way grown together with the " Ring " , " she said shortly before the performance of the dpa .	-5.8187
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but has also grown an understanding of his view .	-4.9079
I draw a positive conclusion .	-3.4652
Max Menge Work as a Voluntary	-2.4749
They work in several places in their volunteer year .	-3.8704
Where do I go ?	-4.3541
Set : Normally in Steinfurt in the Möbelbörse , once a week I help out here in Greven in the Möbelbrücke .	-4.2841
And I have been working on the school all day .	-3.9259
What are your experiences with this ?	-2.3174
Quantity : It is a nice , broad spectrum that I see here .	-3.0800
I have to deal with different people , young people , refugees and young adults .	-2.3104
They are now 26 years , that is to say a belated volunteer .	-3.9156
How does this come about ?	-2.7057
Menge : I have completed my Abitur .	-3.9882
And then a graduate in civil engineering , let us say , successfully aborted .	-6.2580
I realized for me that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people .	-4.2020
And then I wondered what you are doing .	-2.5008
Make a social year , there is an insight , as you can see how it really is on site , at the focal point perhaps also .	-5.3081
And was it ?	-2.5948
Lots : I have collected great impressions .	-4.2074
I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester .	-3.6346
I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Herne 's Youth Welfare Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences .	-4.5920
Is it not a little unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service ?	-4.9016
Quantity : Yes , it is very variable .	-1.7748
It probably always depends on where to do your FSJ .	-3.9717
It can be done from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .	-4.8317
With me it was very varied .	-3.4946
I was also part of the OGS , in the afternoon care .	-4.3010
For me it was just the right thing that made me sick .	-5.7050
I saw my own strengths and how it really works .	-3.3829
Unlike in Civil Engineering ?	-2.9351
Quite clearly , this is not about calculating statistics .	-5.4604
There are always other people in front of you who have a very different story behind each other .	-6.1266
Whether a refugee , or a youth who has been taken out of the family , you always have to deal with it individually .	-5.0886
Very interesting .	-0.5780
And you had no fear of touch ?	-2.9307
Quantity : I am not the type for this .	-3.2868
It is an area that gives you a lot .	-2.2628
I wish you all the best . .	-5.7863
There are also some negative moments , but so life is just like that .	-5.2985
Pearson cuts a further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive business .	-2.6405
The UK ’ s Pearson education group said on Friday that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 % , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces .	-5.2909
The job cuts that Director-General John Fallon announced mostly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs .	-4.8734
In May , Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of <unk> 300 million ( $ 394 million ) in a third cost-cutting program to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning .	-4.5715
The company , which sold its stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner Bertelsmann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 % to <unk> 2.05 billion in the first half of the year .	-4.4900

On Monday , a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .	-1.8574
A statement by NATO states that the explosion had taken place on Thursday evening , when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was ' attacked ' by an improvised bomb carried out by people .	-5.6761
The statement says that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at Bagram airport .	-4.4203

The Taliban said they had carried out this attack .	-2.2792
On May 31 , a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001 .   e  . e  e   e  e  e   e e	-12.2541
The violence underscores Afghanistan ’ s precarious security situation , as US President Donald Trump ponders to increase the number of US troops supporting the country ’ s military and police .	-3.9463
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , President Ashraf Ghani 's reputation .	-4.2001
CEPOL Returns Decision on the Smog Rule Delays Complaints	-4.1511
The US Environmental Protection Agency has repealed a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , which requires states to contain emissions from smog , a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move .	-6.1059
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called ' ozone rules 2015 ' , and said that it showed the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-6.0829
" We believe in the dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , " said EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-4.3584
In June Pruitt announced the EPA 's intention to review the ozone regulations - which aim to measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - in order to delay one year until October 2018 .	-6.5953
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .	-3.6818
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says should boost economic growth .	-4.1073
However , the efforts have caused the setback of the democrats and conservation groups , which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-5.3357
The website of the EPO says that breathing in air containing ozone " can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .	-4.0471
Municipal Council wants Community space	-2.0981
In the end , the decision was clear : with two votes against , the municipal council of Fluoran-Winzeln decides to establish a common area in the future senior residential area .	-5.5003
Before the discussion there is an important information : The contract of sale for the still missing land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-5.3726
While it will still take time for the community ’ s land to be in municipal ownership , there is now no obstacle to planning the project to be stepped up by a private investor .	-10.9284
There is a debate on a Community area for this . the the the a .	-7.1282
One of the two investors who are still on board has offered to meet the community .	-4.0665
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .	-4.6510
The administration and the majority of the municipal council have the idea of providing such a common space not just as a meeting place for the residents of the senior-related housing , but as an open space into the community .	-8.4628
As an example , the word from the " knitting café " made the round .	-4.2107
The decision that was made by allocating funds to the current budget last autumn will be sweetened by means of funding es .	-5.4423
The building is located in the rehabilitation area .	-3.2920
The establishment of a Community area , according to Tjaden , would be eligible for funding at 60 % of 30 % .	-4.9613
The proposal for a resolution provides a signal to the investor that , in this respect , they do not want to throw a stick between their legs , stating that both semi-roof and roof of the pulpit - which reduces the height of the grapes and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .	-8.8537
Needless to say , Wilfried Sohm does not only say that this addition is necessary .	-5.5139
If it helps : unanimity happens to the body .	-3.7914
The common area is not so easy .	-2.6351
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings that are not so good to move forward with , for which we are now opposed to the common room from the window , she says , ' I am hard to do with it ' .	-10.2244
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against local participation .	-5.2642
It sees it as a covert subsidy to already wealthy , even foreign , investors .	-4.4851
That is not the case , because the purchase of the area does not give you a grant , but instead gets a real value that can be marketed in the event of doubt , is the opposite .	-8.7524
Staiger ’ s request to split the proposal for a resolution accordingly finds three supporters .	-4.5411
This leaves two votes against the original programme , which is summarised by Stefan Haller : " If we take the decision in this way , we are taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure " .	-6.4851
A collision with a car : Radler is thrown on the road .	-5.0423
On Wednesday , an 82-year-old cyclist was caught in Garath by a car and was seriously injured .	-5.5776
As the police announced , the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bike on the Schwarze Weg cycle path from Hilden at 12.20     .  e  .	-8.7935
The senior wanted to cross the road up the road Am Buchholzer Busch .	-3.3887
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority .	-2.9007
When the Langenfelder took to the streets , he apparently did not take the opposite approach .	-6.7111
He came together with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildenerin .	-3.6697
The man was dragged onto the street .	-2.4223
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue train .	-3.4949

For the five defeats in the last six test games , Ancarotti blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .	-5.7004
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " Ancarotti said , adding : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-3.7216
That was not good at the end . '	-8.0989
The 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .	-4.1960
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.4529
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-2.4611

Wandering in the Harz of Stern	-2.5215
The first " star path " is to be built in the Harz .	-5.2773
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans this .	-3.0894
Göttingen has a planetary path - since 2003 .	-4.2638
A " star path " meets the information needs of many visitors to Harz , it was said .	-4.5333
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.5328
Members would like to set up blackboards along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-5.4822
In a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning " feasible installations at five to six locations " in Oberharz .	-5.3062
St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiss and Sieber could be called into question .	-4.2161
The information on the panels should be supplemented via Internet .	-3.5492
That is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .	-5.1183
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.3431
Later , the Sidereal Path Zug is to be extended by Zug .	-6.2948
" On the Sidereal Path the viewer will learn a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-6.7481
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star is brighter than another , even though it is much more distant .	-4.8594
It also explains which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see .	-5.8758
Since 2014 , the association has operated the highest observatory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andrew .	-4.6997
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany , according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation .	-4.2507
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can be seen with the naked eye .	-3.9601
Since 2003 , on the initiative of the Society for the Development of Planetarium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned Starwerg - the Planetenweg .	-6.1309
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an " extra-terrestrial " location in Diemarden ( community Gleichen ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.0384
The stelae with the individual planets - including Pluto at the endpoint , reduced to the dwarf planet - are situated exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion .	-5.9905
The Earth is thus shrinking on a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the sun , exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimetres .	-5.5653
The entire distance of the planet 's path is about four kilometres .	-4.5800
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto .	-4.1285
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in space .	-2.3668
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .	-3.1602
Mikey Garcia and Vasil Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-1.4178
Vasil Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who were to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under GBP 147 , met for the first time on Thursday .	-3.8227
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the clumsy World Boxing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super Feder Champion .	-4.3975
After Garcia 's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound list .	-4.7679
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said : " How is it for you , Champion ?	-3.4140
I wish you good luck . '	-1.3476
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN .	-2.1651
When the couple posed for photos , Lomachenko manager Egi 's climate noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect magnitude " .	-6.8997
" I am a former feather weight , " recalled Garcia .	-2.2146
" I rose for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.0499
I am small for 140 .	-0.7439
I want to get down to light weight .	-2.8359
And he must move on to lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-3.3485
That is what the fans demand .	-2.3008
Let us give them that . '	-1.6417
Mr Lomachenko agreed .	-2.0928
'Boxes need this fight ' .	-1.9350
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree next summer with Garcia a date ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) that also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares Luke Campbell on their lightweight title struggle in the forum on 23 September .	-5.7515
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for him , " said Garcia and later openly expressed himself to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.5565
We are the best .	-0.5810
No other names can generate this kind of attention .	-2.1058
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.5464
Garcia said he admired Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter , " and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight .	-5.8640
But Lomachenko held the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-combat champion from Riverside looks " very slow , I 'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-run " .	-6.6673
Garcia said the focus is to show percussion , then boxing .	-2.4435
Both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .	-3.9198
" This is the fight that must be carried out .	-2.5391
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.4767
I am more than happy to work on this , " said Garcia .	-1.6833
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.9732
It will be a great fight . '	-1.6713
Four Wounded After Tyre	-4.3829
In the event of an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .	-3.1867
According to the first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the point of connection of the market width , presumably after a tyre hub .	-11.3072
The car moved to the right into the malice where it went over and then remained on the roof in the green strip .	-6.5100
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident .	-5.0575
While the rescue service provided the first aid to the injured , the A7 towards the north was closed for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by at the accident site .	-7.3787
Fortunas Hoffmann : " Tripartite Funktionen funktioniert "	-4.7017
After the 2 : 2 season break against Braunschweig , Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defence formation in Aue will score points .	-4.9520
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first round of the season , and the result would not have been the two opposing teams at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-6.4806
" These were two opposing points too much , and we need to be even more careful in Aue , " says the defensive player of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.4014
In the Ore Mountains , the Tripartite Chain will also be further optimized .	-4.9834
And a goal after a freekick does not want to capture the Forts .	-7.4108
" For the future , it will be the case that no one takes the line next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-5.6213
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better equipped with the three-chain than with the Viererkette , even after the experience in the preparation .	-8.3596
" I don 't know yet how we will act in Aue " , says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have just in the chain of three players on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gieselmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-6.7062
" It is a prerequisite , but that we harmonize even better and that we do not make so many mistakes in the game . "	-8.2566
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.5336
" But if you can talk about a failed start after a draw , you don 't know .	-4.7709
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-3.9023
However , if we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the Cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper start to the season .	-7.2636
His coach did not want to know about this .	-3.3970
" I will only judge the start of the season after six to eight days , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm .	-6.2874
" Now they can almost start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann , who believes that Aue players might even be a little fresher , because they don 't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in the bones .	-7.3095
" But they do not know 100 % where they stand at the moment , " says the inside defender of Fortuna .	-5.4590
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting at the ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday as a slight favourite .	-7.5151
" That we sweep them away simply because we are entitled to come under the first six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose record is very positive with only a defeat against Aue from nine games .	-6.8358
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start " , explains Fortuna 's chief coach .	-6.1380
'Making such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-1.8626
And so Funkel doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-4.5882
New Results of Sweden ’ s Asylum Age Tests	-7.5552
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-5.1770
The Swedish body for forensic medicine ( Rättsmedicinverket ) started carrying out the tests last year .	-4.1848
During the asylum process , they are supposed to make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish migration authority ( migration law ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-6.9099
To date , migration law has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-5.3768
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.7724
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is " possibly under 18 years old " .	-2.0670
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-3.2371
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.6788
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said to the magazine The Local .	-3.5587
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age .	-3.8727
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases " suggesting that the person investigated was 18 years or older " .	-3.6666
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .	-4.5071
The method of medical assessment of age , in which x-ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticized in some areas .	-5.6344
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of human biological maturity to see if they were eventually or later than usual through puberty .	-5.2715
" I had reason to reflect on this and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.4976
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.6030
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-3.9151
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " Generally , you can say that the risk of an adult being misjudged is low .	-3.7999
The biggest risk is when the person is less than 18 , in this case about 10 % . '	-4.1011
Full Plan	-4.2977
Work on the three bridges between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-4.0229
On Wednesday , a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.5389
" We are very good at the time , it works super , " says Reinhold Leicht , director of the Department of Road and Transport at the Government Headquarters of Freiburg .	-6.1572
In April the work started at the same time on all three bridges in need of repair between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.5209
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be met .	-4.5728
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-3.0037
It is a concrete arched arch bridge covered with red buntsstone and has a total length of 4,80 meters .	-6.1908
It was built in 1900 .	-1.3307
Like the other two bridges , she has come into the years .	-3.8072
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated .	-3.3931
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach river .	-2.8723
They are made of red buntsstone .	-3.2673
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,60 meters long .	-3.3512
On Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach received a bridge cap of 1.30 metres in width and 7 tonnes in the north .	-6.5209
This is a border fastening which is also used as an operating route .	-5.0205
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-4.3875
This is where the pedestrian path should go .	-4.2187
The particular thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-4.1074
The other two bridges are already covered with the patented bridge caps .	-2.8994
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach requires a special touch .	-5.4954
There is also a fibre optic cable , to which many companies are connected .	-4.1919
Residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .	-4.3448
In addition , fish and crabs had to be fished first .	-4.0995
For the bridges between the building and the public utility in the direction of Schramberg , the traffic is controlled single-lane by a traffic light .	-6.1314
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Seven Linden " is fully locked .	-5.9888
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 .	-3.5184
It is financed by the country .	-3.1444
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest at German potato salad .	-2.2418
It is not so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , what is otherwise difficult to reconcile .	-4.4346
The parties represented in the district day of Vulkaneifel ( CDU , SPD , Green Party , FDP , FWG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that , on that day , displays peacefully flags , because the AfD in the Gerolsteinische Stadthalle Rondell invites the poster " Great Election Clock " .	-8.5968
And there are well-known names , such as Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the deputy federal president Beatrix of Storch .	-7.1560
But those who are on the spot hours before the event begins do not want to listen to the AfD ’ s , but to demonstrate .	-5.9952
The motto " The Eifel remains colorful " .	-2.3312
Originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto " All at a Table " on the Brunnenplatz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .	-7.5296
A colorful picture that is there .	-4.6990
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the Forum Ein Welt and one of the authoritative organizers , is right to say : ' Great how many people have met here ' .	-6.1184
There is music and a lot of food , including a " Urdeutsch potato salad , which the AfD could eat without any problems " , says the woman who brought him along .	-12.6791
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , but they are also present at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .	-6.7068
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-2.0530
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has worked for such an event and won the award .	-5.2812
The 45 year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun but got a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes not enough parking spaces .	-6.7550
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.4411
In view of the event on Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the right of the people , the main thing is that it remains peaceful " .	-4.7458
This is also the case : at around 8 o 'clock a band takes care of entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhineland pfälzische AfD chairman Uwe Junge .	-7.9827
There are about 200 people in the Chamber waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch to make their speeches .	-5.6136
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.4815
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour , the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath of breath , but there is also something to be cleared up shortly after 9 p.m.	-8.2034
The police can step down - no special incidents .	-3.8414
Trombone Meets Trumpet	-2.0841
There is a reunion with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli in the series Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .	-4.4132
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto " Black Sea meets Black Forest " , or even " Balkan folklore " meets a classical German training with roots in brass music .	-8.2150
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and perform solo roles in European top orchestras .	-4.1722
Petkov Solotrompeter is at the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo trumpet player of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .	-4.7550
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .	-4.2411
So Johann Sebastian Bach is playing with both of them as in a new guise , Daniel Schnyder 's " world music " unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the " Exchange Suite " of the jazz group Nils Wogram , classical music , jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating overall art work .	-9.3759
This core of the programme was premiered this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .	-4.0128
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .	-7.5715
Kristen Stewart speaks about her bisexuality	-2.0649
" Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .	-1.8857
But I want to try it all , " Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality .	-4.7954
" When I bite in grilled cheese , I think ' Oh that was cool , what comes next ? '	-7.4655
The most famous relationship of Hollywood stars was Robert Pattinson , her " Twilight " colleague , who ultimately fell bitterly apart .	-7.0170
In spite of all this , the brotherly actress says to the " Harper 's Bazaar " magazine : " I was seriously in love with everyone I thought .	-6.4720
Or do you think I had played it ? "	-2.2501
After her separation , Kristen admitted that she was bisexual : " I have always lived and believed dualism .	-4.3669
So I have never been confused or hindered .	-2.4615
I would never like to be taken seriously . '	-3.3410

West Virginia Governor announces that he will change the party .	-3.1425
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party .	-3.0339
Whether you like it or not , the Democrats have moved away from me , " said Governor Justice .	-2.4259
" Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection ... today , as a resident of West Virginia , I will tell you that I cannot help you any more if I am a democratic governor . "	-4.5388
The rally broke out in Jubel .	-2.9762
" Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans , " added Justice .	-2.5888
" As a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . "	-2.7110
Mr. Trump promised a big advance at the West Virginia Rally .	-2.8208
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .	-1.6461
Justice , the only billionaire in the state , according to Forbes , was elected in 2016 .	-2.1510
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .	-2.9124
It is worth about $ 1.59 billion .	-1.2275
Meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying : ' The change of Governor Justice 's party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working rather than trying to make our country great again ' .	-6.1569
" With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , Governor Justice 's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is from above to below without leadership and is unable to find a positive , unifying message , " said the RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News .	-5.9207
Coe praises " honest " Russian excuse for doping scandal	-2.6064
The global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be reintegrated into sport .	-4.8174
Russia ’ s athletics leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress , on the eve of the athletics world championship , that his country ’ s exile from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-5.1310
He said he felt sorry for " all athletes who were caught in gold and silver competitions " .	-4.6308
Despite its comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of government-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.1646
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to reporters .	-2.5480
" The entire Council and Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized with itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . "	-5.9559
Coe said that he was also ' happy ' about Russia accepting the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.3845
" I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia , " said Coe .	-3.2954
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation .	-3.4974
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the banned system , " he added .	-2.8546
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the athletics world championships starting on Friday in London .	-3.8443
On Monday , the head of the IAAF Task Force , Rune Andersen , said that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement .	-3.2116
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to work , he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council .	-5.0629
Commemoration for soldiers crashed in Mali	-4.3211
At a funeral in Fritzlar , north Hesse , around 1000 people thought of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali .	-5.9621
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Cathedral City under high security conditions .	-3.5142
On the outstanding crash , Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing .	-4.5550
She described the two pilots who were in the process of being " capable of their profession " .	-6.9788
" We salute the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she said .	-3.3052
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stakeshauptmann from North Hesse died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali , West Africa .	-4.9640
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday , accompanied by a German Army death guard , they were transported to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter .	-6.2363
At noon only the members of the Church left .	-4.1648
Afterwards , the funeral ceremony began in the family circle , close friends , representatives of the German Armed Forces and politicians .	-5.1593
Among them were Hessen ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-3.9266
The funeral guests laid down roses , the relatives were in arm with the coffins .	-4.8996
In front of the church , Fritzlarer and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .	-3.0507
The Leyen Defense Minister described the soldiers who were killed as " highly decorated " and experienced in action .	-6.5627
The Staksshauptmann was involved in the flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots to be trained in his regiment .	-6.7008
Volker Bauersachs , commander of the regiment , to which the soldiers belong , also said : " If this occupation could not avert the crash , then no one would have been able to . "	-6.3596
Minister von der Leyen did not raise any doubts about the UN mission in Mali : the deployment was dangerous .	-4.7109
But he was also very important ' for a country from which we are separated only by two states ' , she said .	-4.2390
After the funeral the coffins were taken from the cathedral .	-2.2701
When and where they are buried , the Bundeswehr did not provide any information on this .	-4.6478
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife .	-2.4322
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-2.4742
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday .	-3.2295
The Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-3.6093
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.5475
The Queen agreed with her husband 's decision , as the communication continued .	-4.3801
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear .	-1.7836
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .	-3.2388
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title .	-3.6315
After his wife Margrethe ascended to the throne in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-3.1945
In 2016 , he retired and retired as well .	-5.3936
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief spokesperson of the Danish Royal House , explained .	-8.8837
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be , it is still unclear .	-4.3467
However , he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-3.7115
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .	-2.6872
Born in Henri de Laborde de de Monpezat , son of a French noble family , Margrethe had met in London in 1965 .	-2.3846
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy .	-2.7126
During his later wife , Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes during his almost 50-year reign .	-7.5218
In an autobiography , Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticized .	-3.6234
My Danish was volatile , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of socks , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-2.7563
Even for the Gauloises , which I used to smoke instead of Virginia tobacco and which had a reputation in this country to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals , I could not hope for forbearance .	-4.8189
I was different .	-0.8162
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .	-3.2374
These were two mistakes ! '	-2.7730
Prime Minister Weil ’ s Prompt Reelection	-4.3277
CDU and FDP in Lower Saxony	-2.3519
Niedersachsen ’ s prime minister , Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country ’ s parliament , but he does not want to resign .	-10.0997
Because , on Friday , we were in favour of the dissolution of Parliament .	-4.6704
Prior to this , the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her provincial group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .	-5.8038
Five months before the official date of the state election , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-11.5547
The previous Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move by not nominating for the election in 2018 in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-4.7247
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she said on Friday in Hanover .	-2.4532
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they be included .	-3.6190
The CDU and the FDP together would have 68 seats in Lower Saxony ’ s Landtag , the SPD , and the Greens .	-5.0122
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-1.9280
The new country day will be officially elected on 14 January next year .	-4.7012
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation .	-3.0089
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the day of the land should resolve its self-dissolution as quickly as possible .	-6.3529
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-3.5456
The constitution of the country also provides for the possibility that the land day will deprive the Prime Minister of his confidence and elect a successor .	-5.3250
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.7767
These possibilities need to be examined legally , " said Thümler .	-4.8161
'You will discuss all the issues calmly if they are legally considered properly ' .	-6.1945
Thümler called Twenzen Schritt " doch etwas kurios " .	-2.5455
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.6054
I feel very good " .	-1.4647
She called herself a supporter of black and green .	-2.6870
The Greens called for the breakaway MEPs to return their land mandate .	-4.1690
" We assume , of course , that they are giving back with immediate effect their land tenure , which they received via the Green Land List , " said Meta Janssen-Ku<unk>z and Stefan Körner .	-9.0084
The chairman of the Green Group , Anja Piel , said : ' We very much regret Elke Twesten 's decision ' .	-3.9028
She deliberately chose not to have a debate in the group .	-5.2457
'Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step ' .	-4.7319
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the takeover of Lower Saxony ’ s Green MEP Elke Twesten as a betrayal of the CDU .	-4.7071
" The behaviour of the former members of the Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the electorate , but also a betrayal of the red-green , " wrote the head of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday .	-4.8330
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei<unk> ( SPD ) to have the parliament elected quickly .	-8.2309
The exit of Twentz costs the majority in Lower Saxony .	-5.6317
The politician " in her wounded vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country " , criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-4.9361
" It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is playing along with this dirty plot and is trying to make political capital out of it " .	-4.8895
Niedersachsen ’ s CDU faction leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his deputies include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-4.5156
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the 2013 general election with personal career thinking .	-5.3444
The CDU was the strongest power before the SPD , but the SPD and the Greens had a slim majority of one vote in the country day .	-7.5209
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.3275
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.9262
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.7155
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.1990
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is speaking and answering in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.1103
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-2.2847
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp printing .	-3.6669
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebenswarn.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg charges .	-5.8421
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-0.8017
Even if , according to everything we know at the moment , a health risk is virtually excluded .	-4.4529
Does Aldi now accept the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the Federal Agriculture Minister does not really perceive the central role of the educator ?	-5.9731
Food monitoring is a task for the Länder .	-2.4907
Nevertheless , my House has moved on without delay and , since it became known , Germany 's concern has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries .	-6.8152
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.0409
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe to health .	-4.0731
If the maximum residue level for eggs is exceeded by 0.005mg / kg , they are not transportable .	-3.7640
Uncontaminated eggs , however , can be sold and consumed .	-2.5656
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-2.8137
Sitting factories and consumers in the same boat ?	-2.3829
According to the current state of knowledge , production companies are not directly at fault .	-4.4911
Instead , they have to face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-4.7203
As always , there are too few inspectors in the worst case .	-3.1609
Is it only a lack of staff or a coherent competence ?	-5.5461
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.8096
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-3.3178
It is precisely for this reason that it is essential that such events be properly clarified and that the public prosecutor be handed over to the public prosecutor in cases where criminal offences can be committed .	-7.4654
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to provide full information .	-3.5456
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary ?	-2.6283
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable food .	-2.3206
If an illegal insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.5697
The adulterated product has led manufacturers , traders and consumers to a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-5.3824
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the Fipronil insecticide in the position of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-5.6334
This must be done consistently and at all levels .	-5.3382
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and without any gaps .	-5.1763
How football ’ s rules affect Neymars ’ move to Paris	-7.0901
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain .	-4.6335
Some consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the governing organisation that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-6.0135
Financial fair play rules , which were set up by UEFA in 2011 , mean that at some point PSG will have to prove that the Neymar transfer was financed without major losses .	-5.6833
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( <unk> 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .	-5.0982
Here are some of the financial aspects of Nejmars move to France .	-2.0178
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs and brings him to another galaxy of stars , given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar .	-6.4443
Clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but they must deal with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to make the break even point in their football related business .	-6.9062
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007 .	-3.7780
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-4.7276
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-1.8620
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder business .	-4.3329
During the current three-year FFP qualifying period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .	-5.0921
And , while Platini fell from grace by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to discouraging excessive spending .	-5.7590
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traversa , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-7.7315
Although the PSG paid Neymar 's buy-out clause in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for the accounts for the duration of its contract .	-5.0547
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer amount of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years can be recorded in the annual accounts .	-4.4809
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG , along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .	-3.4192
The PSG received a fine of € 60 million ( $ 82 million at the time ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the season 2014 / 15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .	-5.0628
UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .	-5.8931
While a Catholic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not make this a legitimate income .	-6.2773
This is precisely what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.4961
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from the World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022 in Qatar .	-4.4326
But the PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could easily be found for the UEFA regulators .	-6.0035
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.5448
UEFA had no preliminary discussions with the PSG on Neymars Transfer , the people who are familiar with the situation said on Thursday .	-5.3835
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-6.9582
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-4.3311
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published .	-2.8393
PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising and tricot sales .	-2.6500
The association assumes that after signing sales will increase by at least 30 percent .	-3.6415
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and it tried to prevent Neymars ' move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-4.4674
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the president of La Liga , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-6.8426
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is in possession of an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .	-7.5748
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.5450
" As soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.4697
It is going to be very difficult to respect financial fair play because it is possible to take different paths or to have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-5.5758
Swiss is looking for a new genus .	-3.9135
In recent years , Chocolat Frey has produced an on-board chocolate for Swiss .	-3.4809
Now , sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline re-writes the order .	-5.8128
Swiss-Sprecherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report from Friday 's news agency sda .	-4.3082
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.2795
The products are checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .	-3.5550
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.5459
Around 17 million small white , 14 grams of snow packed chocolates per year distribute the cabin crew to passengers before landing .	-7.5755
The Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs .	-3.7823
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to " Northwestern Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs .	-5.2648
But the advertising effect is always more important : it is a prestigious task for a chocolate manufacturer .	-5.3118
The Swiss do not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender .	-3.7639
But only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-2.9634
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey is seeking to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-3.5005
For sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.9662
Since 2006 , the Swiss has distributed chocolate posters on board its flights .	-3.6677
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros ’ daughter , Barry Callebaut , in cooperation with Hug , supplied the chocolate tablets .	-4.4059
Two and a half years ago , Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo with the launch of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.8703
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.4859
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are treated to delicacies from the Sprüngli Confiserie , Business Class naschen Passengers Schoggi von Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey .	-4.8444

Nostalgia enters the niche in Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective .	-2.2982
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 's , for the 90-year grunge era ( when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went to bigger things .	-6.3763
As a cultural artefact , it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-2.9859
But as a franchise , it feels like time is running out .	-1.8987
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a spoken can vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-4.2544
By focusing on the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they were nevertheless unable to win back the last part of the joke .	-6.5313
" Ten Years Later " , with its adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more by the watering can principle , including a reef on the stalker movies of the 1990s such as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " .	-6.1607
At one point , a character sneaks through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.3755
Many of the central stories are the same .	-0.9923
The amiable Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now a novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.8706
Victor Ken Marino has still not lost his virginity .	-1.7998
And there is another insane malicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.4777
As always , the excursion is the best part of the franchise .	-1.3806
It 's a lot of fun to see Mr. Rudd , an eternally young man , who shows Matt Dillon 's signature of " singles " , whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-10.1984
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I assume to be its logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-10.9594
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon now recalls another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War by " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East vs. West Ringfight iconography .	-4.6577
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , with Rhys Thomas as director , indicates to be a TV series found : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism .	-5.3331
The main characters - a hard-edged Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt .	-5.0206
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.3348
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.5842
There are some nice gags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-4.4064
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find the voice out ' .	-3.2609
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single .	-3.5392
In six long episodes it gets lost and the comedy is not fast enough or often enough .	-4.9540
" Comrade Detective " , edited to a smaller length , could better deliver his Agiprop-atire , because Gregor and Iosef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men eating a bunch of hamburgers .	-6.9403
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything fodder for a vow .	-3.8956
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs .	-2.8319

On Wednesday morning numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosecutor 's office of Konstanz announced on Friday .	-5.4857
15 defendants aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and have already issued arrest warrants against them .	-4.6111
In addition , officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros .	-4.0024
Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .	-3.3991
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects Italian .	-2.2856
The two will presumably be delivered to Germany .	-4.9667
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved .	-5.7461
In total , more than 300 police officers were in operation .	-3.5752
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder and extortion .	-3.9531
Since the summer of 2016 , the Prosecutor 's Office of Constance has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany .	-4.1907
There was a strong exchange between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.3143
For this reason , four officials from Palermo accompanied the large number of people on Wednesday morning .	-7.6249
The investigation focused mainly on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia .	-5.0665
Also an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the account of the gang .	-5.4206
Complaints of large gaps in the Foreign Register	-4.2543
" Data from citizens who should not appear here " : According to one report , the German Foreign Register has serious shortcomings .	-6.3786
This partly leads to serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.3115
According to a media report , the Federal Government ’ s refugee management representative , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the list of migrant capital .	-6.5508
Defects in the data recorded there could lead to ' sometimes serious mistakes ' in asylum procedures and deportations , warned in an analysis presented by the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-5.5120
According to the data , the register includes ten million people of foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.7691
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.7900
Because the data has not been properly maintained , some data quality has not been good .	-4.6243
In individual cases , data from 1921 had been found " by people who have long since ceased to live , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register " .	-6.3004
" Incorrect data input can significantly slow returns " , the report goes on .	-5.6857
Moreover , in the statistics on people travelling abroad , EU citizens are included who do not have to leave .	-6.2107
Such false allocations , however , led to ' a distorted debate on the handling of travellers ' , according to the analysis .	-6.3370
Meanwhile , the federal government seems to have begun sending refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy when they have arrived from there .	-4.6672
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-3.8380
The paper thus states that the BAMF is " carrying out such procedures with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 " .	-5.9071
This has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014 , according to the newspaper , pointing to the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.0705
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees are the responsibility of the EU State , which they reach first .	-3.6163
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the country of entry .	-3.3658
To justify this , the office now says : ' In the meantime , the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased substantially ' .	-6.6882
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.5649
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) regards these pledges as sufficient .	-2.4509
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement .	-2.4284
Ulla Jelpke , the political leader of the left-wing group in the Bundestag , criticized this decision : " Families with children are threatening conditions of admission that are illegal in the Italian asylum system and a threat to the welfare of children " .	-7.9450
Second Best Result	-5.1697
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already provided blood donation services to other people .	-4.1564
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-3.5577
Most notably Jürgen Greule , who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .	-4.7887
Traditionally , at the municipal council meeting , the municipality appreciates the willingness to donate blood several times .	-5.4672
" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this , and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood to strangers , even selfless , " said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.8125
" A single blood donation helps several people , " explained the district volunteer leader of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the preserves are crushed into their constituents .	-6.2606
In this way , three people could benefit from blood donation .	-3.9884
At the same time Maisenbacher reported about the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach .	-4.0015
" This year , we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK county management .	-4.7336
Obviously , the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .	-5.4254
Prior to this , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umberbe were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations each .	-5.3754
Half as many people book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pflommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter charge ten times per 500 milliliters of their life juice .	-5.2805
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.2495
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase .	-3.7514
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it kept interest rates on family income in the midst of increasing pressure .	-3.8205
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members rising this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.4850
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.9868
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to rein in the inflation fueled by Brexit , and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.3254
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package issued a year after Brexit .	-2.1087
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <unk> 15 billion more under this system - GBP 115 billion .	-5.2633
Just minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : " In the MPC 's central forecast , GDP remains weak in the short term , as pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh consumption . "	-6.3069
At interest rates , she reiterated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be necessary to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' level than markets expect .	-4.9995
Markets are currently forecasting the first growth in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-3.3800
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.6081
The Bank ’ s downward growth forecasts for this year and next year are relative to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-4.0728
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.4190
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news .	-2.6507
The pound fell by 0.5 % to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .	-2.2324
The decision will not come to any change , after disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest-rate hike , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the second quarter .	-5.2631
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will recover slightly by the end of the year following the Bank .	-4.4320
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small wage increases , as the tightening gets worse first before it gets better .	-9.4202
She added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent ' the loss of income in the next few years , but she added that wages will ' recover significantly ' at the end of her three-year forecast .	-4.9727
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-3.6884
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s decline .	-4.2959
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to reach prices and the economy in full .	-3.8443
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an interest-rate hike had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-hit households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-5.4516
Inflation fell from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , even though the bank said that this was expected and that it would resume in the coming months .	-4.7467
The bank said that the excess relative to its 2 % target was " entirely " attributable to the weak pound .	-4.0914
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortagge Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are clamoring for deals and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.8737
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and new mortgages are closed , and many with royalty-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-6.1047
NHS ( National Health Service ) is alleged to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people .	-3.1798
Patients will have access to a " transformational " HIV prevention treatment in the NHS after a fight in front of the High Court against funding the drug .	-5.4713
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) taken before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-5.9891
He agreed to finance the trial after last year 's Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-4.6619
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK boss Simon Stevens as an " important new intervention " , while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " .	-4.8702
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and further clinics will follow in October before it is introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.9215
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.3580
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection .	-3.1319
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection .	-6.3789
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before intercourse .	-3.4117
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.6930
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgender , and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is notoriously not controlled by anti-retroviral treatment .	-3.8930
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-3.8500
The program will be $ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .	-2.8035
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence , as is targeted , recorded , and implemented on a large scale .	-5.6122
Stevens said : ' This major new intervention should complement and surpass the wide-ranging and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.2995
It is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . '	-4.0207
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.3352
PrEP , when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.1354
From September onwards , people with a high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded effort in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will improve many , many lives .	-5.3569
We very much welcome this announcement . '	-2.1778
Ian Green , chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one with a risk to HIV is left behind .	-4.4231
Now that PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-4.3372
Sharon Hodgson , shadow minister of health , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delay in implementation by the government .	-4.7891
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.2988
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-3.0460
It is now important that this study be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us to move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-5.0291
Living the big life : the mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.4369
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-3.7801
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-6.0502
" Before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge , " says Joanne .	-3.5941
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-2.4356
This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .	-6.2119
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . '	-2.3709
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overhauled .	-4.1470
Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate level to make optimum use of the generous ceiling height .	-5.5519
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.7651
That was my request , " she says .	-2.0049
To this end , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.3999
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level in which to stand .	-3.7794
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task .	-2.4815
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.4524
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other , without having to shrug ourselves .     .        .	-7.6660
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-5.3937
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other at full height - with much additional drama .	-4.8736
For the mezzanine , Retrouvius ’ classic copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area .	-3.7542
Stored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.2223
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-2.4732
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer .	-3.2613
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.7112
At the entrance mirrored units provide space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-3.7640
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.8305
There is nothing new about folding kitchens .	-4.1931
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-3.0991
" A bit of engineering art went into this " , Erfan explains about the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-4.4669
'It is disproportionate so that when you lift the door , it glides very easily ' .	-4.6205
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-4.5444
" At the end of the day you will sell the land or how your property is estimated , " says Erfan .	-3.8788
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the ground . "	-4.0590
Here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room luxury .         e e e e	-8.5134
" The materials are the things you touch and help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.7593
" You don 't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls .	-2.8128
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.2914
It shows that a flat can turn from a standard to something quite amazing due to its good design and increased square meters .	-6.2052
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave .	-2.6798
Brothers Struggle for a $ 500 million Housing Empire	-6.1868
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are in a dispute over one of Victoria ’ s largest property empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.5785
The former director of the ' Carlton-Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lusis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be shared .	-5.2170
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-3.9832
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a deal on Smith Street , Collingwood , in 1973 .	-3.6778
There , the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.1857
It was sold in 1999 for USD 85 million .	-1.5047
This money has been invested in real estate , and De Lusis 's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , and shopping centres in the suburbs .	-4.2366
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lusis family - owns about two-thirds of the company 's assets , and Paul owns about one-third .	-8.1836
A legal act says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth of property and Paul $ 176 million .	-4.4135
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.6984
" The distributions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit .	-4.4123
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-9.3221
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business , which Colin , as Paul claims , ruled out .	-4.7415
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of administering some possessions incompetent .	-3.6715
In an early Affidvit filed by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-3.0725
" My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.7185
Costs are increasing with hundreds of pages of revenue , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-5.4711
Mrs De Lusis and her late husband , Luigi , were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-4.3688
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property , where Colin opened the family 's first ever shop .	-4.4585
Colin says that he started Westco when he was " high school in my last years when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-4.0058
Anna De Lusis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .	-2.9124
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " she wrote .	-2.0823
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lusis group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when he left the company .	-3.3683
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says , were " bitter about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-4.0790
Colin held back even though he was a former AFL board member and , after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , the TV star ’ s best friend .	-4.9072
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lusis and their lawyers .	-1.4286
Only Colin answered via SMS to say " I really can 't say much " because the case was before the courts .	-3.7565
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to take our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-3.3699
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the Court that he had tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-5.8428
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said , adding that he " still hopes for a solution " .	-3.8588
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-4.9271
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " said Colin .	-2.5236
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-1.9104
Others tried and failed .	-1.5092
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-2.1752
If so , he will be the first .	-1.2430
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the leader on a more consistent course .	-3.8607
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.0098
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met senior officials on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that falls into the hands of the president .	-8.4562
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . '	-4.3872
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-2.1907
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.9058
" If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions to be convinced , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-5.0265
Political Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption carries a steady price of praise . "	-4.4578
Okay .	-0.9759
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.9859
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don ’ t know - that Trump ’ s tweets would contain even more fuel without their interventions .	-4.3176
We will probably never hear about the tweets Trump has not sent .	-2.8133
If his colleagues have managed to keep him out of trouble several times , then their efforts have been worthwhile .	-4.9933
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.6816
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties continue to try to advance their own agenda by presenting to Trump material that might promote their views from the world .	-4.6206
In May , Politico , which is entirely concerned with this story , reported about the consultants ' preference to supply the president with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-8.0773
This was an example described by Reporters Shane Goldmacher :	-2.1542
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clippings , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is anxious to find out where they come from .	-5.3196
This is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy steward Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a pile of leaks " in the White House .	-4.9675
Although Johnson was permanently barred from Twitter for harassment , or offered no concrete evidence , or that in the past he made false accusations and revoked them .	-5.6761
Trump read the article and began to ask people about Walsh . "	-3.4699
Goldmacher added that former chief of staff , Reince Priebus , and White House Secretary Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives . "	-3.6848
How did this work ?	-1.9858
Kelly will try to do the same three months later .	-2.3330
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-2.7908
These immutable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.6132
Europol sends the most wanted criminals a mail .	-5.1974
Since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped .	-4.6587
Police across Europe this summer send ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .	-3.2322
As the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not known by nature , information from the population is hoped for and requested .	-6.6487
On Friday , Europol reported on the action following the winter ' EU Most Wanted ' Advent calendar .	-6.7780
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations , as Europol said .	-4.2591
We have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries .	-3.1685
Since 2016 there has been the site www.eumoswanted , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed .	-3.9768
36 of the online visitors have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them because of references to the publication on the website .	-5.4311
Travellers negotiate a divide and return to the ' millionaires ' series .	-3.2758
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travelers who negotiated a moat drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their stately homes .	-5.3538
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , which is called the " millionaires series " .	-3.6131
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters , after they were thrown out in May , without , however , being deterred by a ditch dug out by the Council in order to prevent their . the the the the the the a a a	-8.9857
The tactful group found a gap in defense equipment and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unaffected to find a way .	-4.3264
Angry residents have afflicted the Council of Solihull , who said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-4.0458
An anonymous resident said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-5.0570
The Council must be forced into action by shame , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.8632
The travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back .	-3.8120
More came last night , probably more today . '	-3.6819
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect its parks .	-4.0864
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.9007
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-4.9841
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park . '	-3.9507
As one speaker of the Council of Solihull said , " We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the police of Solihull .	-5.9456
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-3.3069
This will help to create an image of the situation in which the Court will have to examine when we submit our case . '	-4.8268
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise .	-2.7235
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-2.6458
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-5.1929
This is good news for the city .	-1.6856
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , about 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and income from the visitors ' tax was also lost .	-5.6349
In the autumn of 2014 , with the dramatic increase in the numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Council Office as a collective accommodation , causing controversial discussions .	-8.3816
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.7175
At the time , the decision was not uncontroversial in the local council .	-4.0015
However , especially in Freudenstadt , Lord Mayor Julian Oswald defended the hotel ’ s location and even then spoke of serious interest in the house .	-8.9189
He should be right .	-1.1794
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-4.7446
The group has four houses with the object of joy .	-2.2308
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-2.4925
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.6962
At the former Hotel Birkenhof building blocks have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house you will see what major renovations are going on .	-7.2965
The floors were torn out , blankets partly dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-4.3451
The entire hotel building is a single construction site .	-2.3536
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.0181
" It is actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.6931
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.9108
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-4.2428
Everything should later be " very close to the citizen " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-4.4888
'We want to make a jewel out of it ' .	-2.3847
The facilities include a swimming pool , spa and meeting room .	-3.7218
The hotel was very clean and comfortable .	-7.1517
The Waldhotel Luise , with its about 60 rooms , wants to stand up to a large extent , says Scherer .	-6.7134
Whether you are a tourist , a group or a business traveler , the hotel is the perfect place to stay .	-7.4558
He has already held talks with OB Julian Oswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause , says Scherer .	-3.7911
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.9511
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.4939
Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise about the level of investment .	-4.0381
Almost under one million euros , he expects .	-3.3263
The outside systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .	-5.6952
A large terrace is created in a courtyard which will be accessible from the restaurant which is open to the public .	-5.4057
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.5630
Russia affair : United States Special Counsel	-6.3369
In US President Donald Trump ’ s Russia affair , Special Investigators Robert Mueller is alleged to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.3183
The panel has started work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " , referring to people familiar with the matter .	-5.3688
The newspaper valued the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation .	-3.7504
The CNN channel reported that there are already first subpoenas from the board in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.9158
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-2.5786
Mueller is investigating whether there was any agreement between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-3.1515
The investigation will focus on several men who campaigned as Republican adviser .	-4.1730
Mueller reportedly also scrutinized more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.8062
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator has personally brought Trump to the center and investigated the charge of whether the president might have impeded the judiciary during the affair .	-6.8681
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence in the event of possible criminal offences and to decide whether to prosecute them .	-7.1266
Grand juries are therefore also referred to as chambers of indictment .	-4.2281
In most cases they are turned on when there are major and controversial cases .	-4.7030
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-1.7715
The body may also be contacted by the public prosecutor to invite persons to be taken under oath .	-5.8620
According to CNN , charges have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.5285
People who took part in the meeting were asked to make a statement , as the report said .	-3.9598
They should also provide documents .	-1.1405
Along with Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were on the conversation .	-4.7200
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the appointment shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he wants to act quickly .	-5.3038
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge .	-7.2788
Yet setting up the body is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-4.5530
Amid the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.9147
" Russia 's story is a complete invention , " Trump said .	-4.7049
The issue gives democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.9503
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-4.0293
But they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-4.3332
The White House is in favour of any measures to speed up the work of the Special Investigator in a ' fair ' way .	-4.2210
James Comey , former FBI chief , has said three times that the president is not being investigated .	-3.0742
There is no reason to believe that something has changed , as the statement continued .	-3.9294
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-6.0873
Because of this groundswell , accusations against Trump had been made that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary .	-5.6403
Comey told a Senate Committee in June that Trump asked him to stop the investigation of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.3217
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.2539
After the presentation of U.S. media , the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff .	-4.6991
This triggered speculation as to whether Trump would dismiss Mueller .	-2.9883
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Investigator , such as the Watergate affair of President Richard Nixon , who resigned later , Mueller has a position in which , in theory , he could be fired by the Justice Department at the president ’ s insistence  .	-9.0313
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.5855
On Thursday , two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft legislation that would prevent the Special Investigator from being dismissed so easily .	-4.7378
Antarctica ’ s Giant iceberg	-1.3882
In western Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has been removed from the shelf .	-10.0501
This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-3.1485
The colossus , weighing more than one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers , is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years until it has melted .	-6.1405
It is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered for the past three decades , with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-4.8032
He does not pose a threat to people .	-2.9676
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear , according to research .	-4.6173
However , for some 30 years now , there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice clips in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-6.4169
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming .	-2.4503
The now cancelled colossus was part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-3.9858
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.2342
As a result , it continues to grow into the sea and it regularly es .	-6.3626
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.7263
North of this horseshoe , the balance of waxes and breakages was disturbed a few years ago .	-4.8302
A complete tool has been broken down there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-5.1910
There is much to be said that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-6.4393
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and may collapse if a key is broken down .	-7.0235
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea levels , as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it produces after melting .	-5.3083
However , the loss of the Schelfeise means that glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .	-5.5416
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on Antarctic observation ( Midas ) .	-4.8767
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis , according to AWI data , is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.4258
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters .	-4.6364
It regularly breaks down there .	-3.3870
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.8015
" This is the most extensive retreat since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-4.1104
Among scientists , it is debatable whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly fall together , his colleague Adrian Luckman added : " Our models say that it will be less stable " .	-6.2143
But that will take decades .	-2.1921
Although these researchers do not attribute the demise of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , in recent decades , a great many ice axes of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed .	-6.2394
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America .	-3.4754
According to the British Antarctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.2517
The temperature rise contributed to the decline .	-2.6478
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees over the past 50 years , making it one of the fastest growing areas in the world .	-4.9478
The CDU Wants Pet Tariff	-4.9716
As it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant positions , the CDU is calling for the resignation of the employers ' association in order to become more attractive .	-5.7454
Just before the summer break , Kreistag swung 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.1916
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the Mettmann County Authority .	-2.6895
17 trainees have now left their first working day .	-4.2149
The apprenticeship places near the circle are obviously very much in demand .	-5.1768
Some 620 applications have been submitted for this year .	-5.8045
However , the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .	-4.6294
At present , there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann circle .	-3.8638
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are required .	-5.2821
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UWG , now wants to take the initiative in the district day to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .	-6.8279
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to " develop a concept for recruiting and personnel development " .	-5.4184
The aim is not only to meet short-term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter the shortage of candidates in a forward-looking manner , it is said .	-6.3904
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , show concrete measures for cross-entry competitors and include a training offensive , call for the CDU , the FDP and the UWG .	-6.1171
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.3784
Because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that were previously unknown .	-5.4301
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.6898
We are talking about genuine ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.5136
In addition , a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-4.4908
So it is time to act so that more jobs are not left vacant .	-5.4165
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , CDU leader , goes further than the joint motion with his party .	-6.0347
He was a lazy surprise recently at the round table , when he publicly questioned the cap on human resources and stunned the other parties .	-8.6813
People want to see a review of all the options that will enable them to leave the local employers ' association .	-5.6812
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding towns - should aim for a pet tariff , " says people .	-7.0700
By doing so , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the Public Service tariff system actually provides .	-7.6055
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed , increases or more money is only available if you switch to a higher level , based on professional years .	-7.1950
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown more and more in recent years .	-2.9786
Only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up for employees to take care of the provisions of the new law on prostitution protection .	-5.6116
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , the Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-4.5057
Italy ’ s Toning of NGO Migrants ’ Rescue Boots	-3.9768
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they adhere to new rules for their operations .	-4.3512
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minniti , in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-7.0476
Minor 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Youth Save ' , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-5.1934
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.6101
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-4.9378
'We can only judge all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-5.4324
The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from ' Youth Save ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.4552
It is believed that his crew will take rubber boat migrants on board , who will be delivered to them directly from human traffickers , and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that ships can be used again .	-7.1888
At least such a meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Public Prosecutor 's Act , the content of which was published by Italian media .	-4.8993
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason .	-4.3933
Under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-3.7147
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.6518
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not entail ' significant changes or disabilities ' in their rescue operations .	-4.4658
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Laureate Organization Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.3292
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , pointing out that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-5.6080
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.3947
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.6988
Rise and Trials	-1.6578
Nine bikers from Weilermer , the " Berlin Outpost " and two guests met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-4.7934
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .	-2.4531
Accommodation in the Wachau Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.6987
The Wachau Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra .	-2.2599
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-3.7938
It was followed by observation points , partly on towers , which could be seen far above the Palatinate forest and the surrounding plains .	-6.7301
In between , there were always longer climbs , for which long trials rewarded .	-7.8108
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurzmarkt .	-3.3973
Again , the vantage point at the viewpoint , coupled with the " flowy " trials and moderate climbs .	-8.0960
On the last two days we had a lot of vertical meters .	-4.7075
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and retreats brought welcome breaks .	-3.7698
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed the brine in the open-air inhalatorium .	-4.4064
New Town was also under way .	-2.5692
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural .	-4.6630
Console instead of Pit - Bundesliga equips for E-Sport	-4.9313
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future , instead of fighting over the stadium pitch in wind and weather ?	-6.8131
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - including big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high stakes .	-5.4464
The first Bundesliga teams , which are increasingly involved in this area , have recognized this .	-6.1317
FC Schalke 04 followed the lead in 2015 , and last but not least VfB Stuttgart , who founded an e-sports division in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .	-7.0096
" We hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for VfB , " says Management Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-4.8782
He is sure that " many clubs will climb on this train " .	-4.6458
Next weekend , the FIFA World Football Association will be organising the first Interactive Club World Cup in London , where the gamers of different clubs will compete .	-6.5049
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-3.2076
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports .	-2.2807
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now consulting an agency for virtual football players .	-3.0555
" Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-5.0742
And : The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.9274
With prominent e-sportspersons under contract , you could be present on these markets much more online than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year .	-6.7091
What exactly is this about ?	-2.2441
In E-Sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or even the football simulation FIFA are played at competitive level .	-5.7305
As in normal sports , leagues have long established themselves in which the pros compete .	-4.3022
And the 2022 Asian Games already make e-sport part of the official program .	-4.2485
But is it a real sport ?	-2.6508
For many , the idea is certainly in need of getting used to .	-4.0879
Ingo Froevil has also dealt with the question for a long time .	-4.5465
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport , because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sport - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.6448
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid reaction capability .	-3.6471
Professional gamers should train not only at the console , but also their bodies and take care of nutrition .	-4.2623
" The fitted player is a good player . "	-2.4789
But there are also problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-5.3208
Controls are difficult to implement in online games , and the structures of classic sport were lacking in the scene .	-5.0670
On the positive side , the scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sports .	-3.7559
Players travel internationally , like a large global family , because there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.8552
A study by the Deloitte management consultancy and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth in e-sports .	-4.6446
In 2016 , it was € 50 million implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship , and big tournaments .	-4.6757
In three years , sales will be 130 million .	-2.7691
This is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga .	-5.9500
However , E-Sport is " not far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , the Deloitte consultants write .	-4.4350
Many countries are already abroad .	-3.3559
Major markets are Asia and the USA , where former basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports .	-3.0443
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider unique .	-3.2627
There is also something going on in Europe .	-3.2434
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says Froevil .	-4.8967
According to Dutt , the Dutch and French football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.9231
" Germany is lagging behind in European comparison , " says VfB 's Executive Board .	-6.0559
It is no longer enough to indulge in nostalgia , and to embellish the old times .	-5.7031
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market .	-4.0515
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.2169
'You cannot say that only football remains the same as it always was ' .	-5.8983
Toxic Egg Alternatives to Cooking and Baking	-2.6038
Almost all the federal states are now affected by the scandal of contaminated eggs .	-4.7356
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany .	-4.0722
Only eggs that are shown to have no Fipronil are to be taken into the shelves .	-6.5337
Michelle Carter condemned the texts that Conrad Roy is pushing for suicide .	-3.1446
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .	-3.8057
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars , and five years have been suspended on probation .  .    ,        e	-6.9289
Carter was convicted in June of careless killing of Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.8486
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is unchallengeable .	-5.6260
My son was my best friend . '	-0.9631
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .	-2.0378
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .	-3.5437
dressed in red pants and a cream blouse , Carter stood in the eyes with tears , with folded hands and looking down when she was condemned .	-4.7974
" Their actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the lawyer to the court .	-3.0114
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.0082
She has not taken responsibility , " she said .	-2.6317
" She did not show remorse " .	-2.4443
But Carter 's lawyer said that it was a " terrible circumstance that she completely regrets " .	-5.4753
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find out that her " age or maturity , or even her mental illness , have a significant impact on her actions " .	-4.3352
A prosecutor read a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy , saying that " there is no day when I am not mourning the loss of my beloved son .	-4.4832
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything .	-5.3789
Roys sister , Cambyn Roy , said that she was " persecuted " by the realization that she would never attend her brother 's wedding or be an aunt to his children .	-5.6382
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.9365
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.7194
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.2053
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that it encouraged him to end his life .	-2.9418
" Hang up , jump off a building , arise yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .	-4.8577
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : ' You must do it , Conrad ' and ' Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.8801
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she benefit from the case through any press .	-4.0577
The case has divided legal opinion .	-4.9739
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British resident in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago .	-3.8807
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , made a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not imprisonment ' .	-3.3227
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the FC Bayern ’ s new Mini-Lahm	-3.3307
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as captain at the Audi Cup is no accident .	-7.0417
The FC Bayern has the courage to win the Confederate Cup in a big season - no extra motivation is harmful .	-7.7020
Something else was on his seat in the cabin , which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately , even though the additional garment was very , very small .	-3.7090
But since there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer on the second day of the Audi Cup , far and wide , he stopped his bandage .	-5.7831
" The coach didn 't announce it , " said the Confederate Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as a Bayer captain .	-5.8315
Well , the mount could have run better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.0074
But Kimme could also interpret the sign of the coach .	-5.0124
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as a playleader by young players , debutants and professionals who had just come out of the holiday , but	-13.6199
Sugar is best distributed to those who are trusted with a lot of humour .	-6.2145
So if you have been chosen to take up the legacy of Lahm , you will need a little extra motivation .	-6.2308
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player to take responsibility " .	-3.3384
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flirted over the field as a mini-Lahm .	-3.5180
Right back , this is his position , the white tie on the arm did the rest .	-4.7777
And Kimmich looked like the one who could take the helm best .	-7.0846
He gave instructions to try to steer the battered force .	-4.3995
He looked for the whole thing , while many others were preoccupied with himself .	-4.9445
Vidal ’ s lack of fitness ( couldn ’ t do it ) ; Renato Sanches ’ failure to follow the performance of the Asian tour ( could not be worse , too ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle ’ s first performance in the Bavarian Grand Prix did not go negative .	-12.5151
That was a good thing .	-4.9558
Süle ran alongside Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acted sovereign .	-5.2698
The namently occupied Napoli storm often struggled , and Süle also tried to succeed a few times during the match .	-7.7417
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped for ' .	-3.6358
But he also performed well in the debut .	-4.2393
Relocation , change of tempo : " I got this style too " .	-5.7577
How unusual this Bayer world is for the new entrants was seen after the match .	-5.8690
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but definitely six or seven interviews .	-2.7056
Kimmich quit after a few short statements in the back of his new players .	-3.9484
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here , I have already noticed .	-4.0800
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-3.4869
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .	-2.9760
Alabama Motivated Women	-3.9604
David Alaba believes in the success of our FB-Ladies .	-3.5057
Austria ’ s most famous football player has announced his Twitter presence just before the match , and has been happy to welcome the Austrian FB-Ladies .	-10.2372
The Bavarian Legionnaire is a sort of club shirt by Austrian captain Schnaderbeck .	-9.0506
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation injection .	-3.6538
Perhaps our ladies could also need the famous Bavarian dusel .	-5.2914
Companies content with Rhineland Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wisconsin ’ s Tempo	-5.2872
It was often irreconcilable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-4.8339
This is apparent after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-3.7463
On the subject of T V , regional Chambers and companies are talking about a change in economic policy - and at the same time they are accusing the old minister .	-6.9485
Frank Natus , chairman of the Trierer Unternehmen Association ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy , which Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.9409
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenauer is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities .	-5.1014
This year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure , with the right to build by 2021 .	-6.3817
The western bypass of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan , also plays a role in the country 's plans .	-11.8549
The aim is to start the line in December 2020 , says Minister of State Cornelia Holtmann .	-4.6543
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but international competing companies .	-4.1472
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier is seeking , as Wissing suggested , a Rhineland Pfalz label for wine to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been dropping for ten years .	-6.1650
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , praises the IHK .	-4.6331
In the new master bonus , the Fachhandelskammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-4.5824
A premium of EUR 1000 for the completed master examination and EUR 2500 is planned if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master training .	-6.4560
But the homework list for the country remains long .	-2.8116
The planned road construction was quick to create facts and at the same time lacked the necessary personnel , says Jan Glockauer , chief executive officer of the IHK Trier .	-6.6364
Of the 56 new engineers who want to employ Wissing in the country ’ s mobility operations , only 29 positions have been filled .	-6.2700
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices .	-3.2142
Christian Balduf , the CDU Group ’ s deputy , refers to the Court of Auditors ’ calculations that the country is investing more than EUR 20 million less in receiving country roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed .	-6.3248
Frank Natus also expects a country ’ s approach to solving the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.7185
It is also sobering to see the country ’ s broadband expansion so far .	-5.7456
In 2016 , regional companies had only rated network supply by 3.4 in an IHK survey .	-5.0288
They complained about stalled Internet connections and breakdowns .	-3.0292
Former Minister of Economics , Eveline Lemke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .	-5.3400
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , Germany , where , after four months of disagreements , she once again admitted the field .	-6.9139
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash .	-3.6836
One day before the announcement by Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.7564
The chairman of the BMW Group said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based , to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-5.3109
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe modifying to reduce its diesel emissions .	-3.5879
None of the companies described the undertakings as a call-back .	-2.5536
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-3.2233
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.1979
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.5269
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being charged with fomenting powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.7704
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which have been able to regulate emissions by using so-called shut-off devices to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but is driving back under normal driving conditions .	-10.6321
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.3672
Last month , Audi arrested the former head of thermodynamics in engine development in Germany .	-5.4690
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States .	-2.7371
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was extended .	-4.2390
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profit .	-4.7882
This message has the raft on Saturday ’ s Isar	-4.4944
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.7535
In order for the visitors of Isar to participate , a raft will take place tomorrow in Munich , which has a special message .	-6.8829
On Saturday the river Isar will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbach bridge .	-5.7468
And this is not a usual raft , with Isar tourists .	-3.5103
The construction unit in particular wants to clarify .	-5.5976
On the raft you can see a large information transparency .	-6.8077
It shows a garbage pit .	-2.5529
The start of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-3.1961
With the motto " True Love is ... " , the understanding of the river Isar is to be understood as a safe river .	-7.0828
Last summer , the river Isar ran the raft , and this year , too , there are further actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally responsible attitude .	-7.2601
Mordillo ’ s Knollen and the Laughter Against the Pain	-5.3182
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoonists , and the Knollen noses of his figures are his trademark .	-7.2918
Even with 85 , the Argentine still draws and works on a film .	-3.4183
His message : laughter , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-1.9735
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4 , 1932 .	-2.1208
In his first years as an artist , he was one of the founders of greeting cards , which frustrated him .	-7.0396
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , " he once said .	-8.7429
After his graduation in Lima , New York and Paris , he achieved a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in the " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.7401
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.6733
Time and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-3.1311
Large , round Mordillo figures are depicted in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .	-6.4439
In the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.5857
With calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , t-shirts , plush toys and watches , his drolly figures continue to spread worldwide .	-5.4549
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon and TV series with his characters .	-4.7599
The main character in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillo 's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousandth footer as an opponent .	-5.8792
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film , which is scheduled to be released in 2019 .	-4.9548
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it 's strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.5103
The script is not written by him .	-2.3758
This is why he prefers the television series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without a word .	-6.0050
Provence ’ s Lavender of Climate Change	-3.3233
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.2238
Lavender is declining due to drought conditions and disease-causing insects , which is a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.1127
Eric Chaisse , expert of CRIEPAM in Provence , said : " Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-5.7602
This affects the life of lavender .	-2.7375
There is also a small Zikade , a microbacterial that transmits dwarf cicadas , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-5.6007
And the stakes are high .	-1.8457
Lavender oil attracts not only tourists , but also for perfumes and cosmetics .	-3.6397
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.1525
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.3404
The solutions envisaged include better water distribution and a slowdown in evaporation from the soil , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-4.4701
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhoen celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year .	-2.7912
The peak is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .	-4.2468
On these days , cranes , guilds , merchants , vagaries or a land kneading camp are to be experienced in the city centre .	-7.7342
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico	-2.5029
The members of the weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime , corrupt officials , and incessant drug wars .	-4.4212
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.2038
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.6283
Two senior journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of grenade attacks in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.8561
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.6818
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to make perceptions and feelings of abdominal pleasure .	-5.4016
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s or cartels ’ pay lists , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos in Mexico dangerous .	-4.9923
There is no respite from the violence and , while bodies are accumulating throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 ; 589 are under federal protection following attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-6.0261
Among the latter is their editor and inspiration of Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.2350
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug violence .	-3.1791
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the fa<unk>ade of the Riodoce building .	-8.4502
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-2.2037
Although a special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , these only opened two criminal proceedings .	-13.4601
As with most thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .	-3.4893
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are irreproachable and even though the terrain is now more treacherous .	-5.7119
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-3.6161
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.8483
'As long as we do not know why , we all distrust ' .	-2.8597
On the morning of 15 May , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan .	-3.4795
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced out of his car and shot 12 times on him , probably because of the newspaper 's name - which is translated with name .	-11.1449
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.0046
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.6602
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.5634
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan .	-1.6816
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the Valdez issue .	-2.6602
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.1390
It doesn 't matter if someone or several people are shot on the street every day in Sinaloa , or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storied mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .	-6.0203
For one minute , forget that there is a state of ' calm ' if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-4.2063
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .	-4.3892
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.9316
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.1452
This publication may have upset the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-4.7818
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.4552
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.2746
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.7047
He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in equity .	-5.6759
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.7150
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.2987
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with .	-5.1923
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Award " for her coverage in Latin America .	-2.6185
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led .	-4.1448
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-2.1441
" I want to live , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.6840
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompewage TV .	-3.4598
" You have to take on the task that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool .	-3.9445
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-7.2612
The Riodoce team is missing Valdez , the bird of fun who could curse like a port worker , a friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-4.2067
They relied on his routine .	-1.8504
He would always wear his hat .	-1.2638
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.9220
Now they ask : Was his love for routine his corruption ?	-2.2641
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job while remaining alive .	-3.5493
" You don 't like it when you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to move drugs .	-4.9637
" These things were not allowed , " Bojorquez said .	-2.1097
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.2351
Trust his own instincts .	-0.9414
If it smells wrong , stay away .	-2.6411
The trouble is said by the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that " smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier . "	-3.5912
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as they do in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states , where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.7568
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.2192
In the space where Riodoce staff met for security training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed , and days before it became known that spyware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.3273
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shade of a tree .	-2.7582
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-3.5465
Half jokingly , some reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police officers that the governor himself called untrustworthy .	-3.9980
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountains , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.5871
For this week ’ s edition , Riodoce has drawn on three main stories .	-4.1654
There was the murder of the brother of former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.7700
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the governor ’ s home town .	-3.0235
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , one block away from the office of the prosecutor .	-3.1057
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities .	-4.6398
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which ruled all political levels almost the whole century .	-4.4222
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high quality corruption .	-3.2372
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.1281
A few months earlier , readers would have regarded the Valdez column as the most informed source of the abduction .	-3.5973
" In the past we would have known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , nicknamed " El Flaco " because of its slim body statue .	-4.0852
" Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken . "	-2.5084
The Valdez office has been transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-9.5344
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the office of the prosecutor for another journalist the next morning .	-4.5776
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.8787
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.2582
Throughout the country , journalists have become more vocal by writing on pavements and buildings in organized protests " SOS Press " .	-5.0536
On that day , director Bojorquez is away from Washington and is trying to gain international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-5.3670
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth .	-3.5982
She has since asked for it to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has broken her objectivity .	-4.5449
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved in it , and an equal society .	-4.2737
In his last book , Narco Journalism , he wrote that reporters are being killed not only by drug gangs , but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime .	-5.1677
The media Guardian Group " Articulo 19 " has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year .	-3.9419
" You die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.1064
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.7042
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.4057
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-3.4509
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .	-2.9926
Some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-8.3098
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-3.2429
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled " What do you want from us ? "	-4.0351
Some journalists have fled their home states , or even out of the country .	-5.2503
It is a painful decision .	-0.8223
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-3.3332
And sometimes they are hunted , as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz .	-3.8249
For those who are left behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-2.9200
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking scares him .	-2.5003
" Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became a reporter , " he said .	-4.9698
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Riodoce sat on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones suddenly started to hum .	-4.4533
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-3.7009
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartels in the region .	-2.9493
From the bottom of the curb you have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone .	-5.7774
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.5681
Sirens shot nearby - another shooting in the area .	-4.5606
Bojorquez looked at the police officers holding guards to see if they were ready .	-3.7225
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-2.8796
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa , Riodoce ’ s employees followed his footsteps .	-5.1714
'How can you only think of closing this , ' said Bojorquez , ' when , on the same day that Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting . '	-5.8158
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies .	-2.9853
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a terrifying one .	-2.4776
Researchers have now found that the first findings of a Canadian mountain worker 's incredible rhino were so well received that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs " .	-4.4848
It was so well received that they could even find out that his jabby skin was red brown - and they said that she had something of a " troubled past " .	-6.3641
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " described him as " the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " .	-6.7057
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaur , which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.6198
His incredibly well preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-4.1541
According to reports in National Geographic , the armored plant carnivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-3.2739
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.9126
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-4.1954
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.1638
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) heavy ground clumps .	-3.8084
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be unveiled .	-6.2545
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is visible .	-4.4230
" It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa the dinosaur . "	-3.7381
Researchers have found that , although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , this herbivore was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs .	-4.7753
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.1811
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and escape from its enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.4557
The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.3203
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-3.9901
The astonishing conservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body .	-4.6150
They discovered the creature 's contouring , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the creature 's tip was darker than its base .	-4.4323
Although contouring is common , the results are surprising , as Borealopelta ’ s size far exceeds that of today ’ s animals .	-4.5512
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs , that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .	-4.1419
But most contemporary animals using contouring - think of roe deer , zebra , or belfry animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-6.6091
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been , " Brown said .	-4.0303
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was redbrown .	-2.2989
Scientists continue to study the animal for evidence of its life , including its preserved intestinal content , to find out what it had eaten as its last meal .	-4.3889
They believe that when he died , the dinosaur came into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .	-5.1461
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today .	-3.6446
" This Nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , " Brown said .	-4.5499
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period .	-3.5865
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you just look a little with your eyes , you might almost think it 's sleeping . "	-6.9083
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs , standing on two legs , crossed the earth .	-4.1896
Although the king of them , Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years in Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-6.6852
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .	-3.9663
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the magazine Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mumified in the mud .	-4.1541
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-3.0204
According to the museum , it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the muzzle to the hip .	-5.7479
Creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.3648
It contained two 20-inch long tips that ragged from its shoulders .	-3.5511
Researchers believe that the armored herbivore was washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-4.3055
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail .	-2.4070
The petrified remains of this special example are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover rough panels along the dinosaur .	-5.6847
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as ' rare as a gain in the lottery .	-2.7433
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.9789
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bribed panels that carry the skull of the animal .	-6.8747
His right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .	-4.3679
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.9180
In a thunderstorm : mass carousel on A8 : Many injured .	-4.5184
An accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Knapp 30 vehicles are involved in mass car rally .	-7.5685
There are many injuries , kilometres of traffic jams and gaffer .	-2.8920
On the motorway Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) some 20 people were injured on a mass rally on Thursday afternoon .	-4.5111
At about 5 p.m. between the connecting points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) , there were almost 30 vehicles during a thunderstorm , probably including trucks .	-6.8624
The exact number of injured persons was not reported .	-6.1644
A police officer said that this is a minor to medium-serious injury .	-7.0025
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site .	-3.4222
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .	-2.5885
In the direction of Munich , there was a backlog of about ten kilometres .	-9.1852
As a AZ reporter reports , there have also been massive obstacles on the back lane - through numerous gaffer .	-6.5659
The fire department took note of the vehicle 's drivers , who are now facing severe penalties .	-6.4525
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.9209
In the process , there was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car .	-5.4685
A rescue helicopter went to the accident site .	-2.9848
Deutsche Bahn : Group Test " Comfort Check-in "	-2.5598
It ’ s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing knowing is sitting in the train and sleeping .	-5.4926
Or one is deeper in his work and has just a brilliant idea .	-3.9249
And then : pufff .	-0.7087
Come the conductor and wake you up unmoved or pull the passenger out of the middle of the workflow .	-5.7570
Card control .	-3.1742
But the times of interruptions are soon over .	-3.8058
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the lifeless ticket control .	-4.1926
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devalue your ticket .	-5.2093
Currently , a test operation is running on two tracks .	-3.9086
" If the offer comes up , we extend it .	-4.2998
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a railway speaker .	-4.5288
" Comfort Check-in " is the name of the train for ticket cancellation without conductors .	-5.5828
However , to be able to use them , you need a smart phone or a tablet .	-5.4362
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do .	-3.6259
You also have to buy it via the train that DB Navigator purchased , which is the most convenient way to book your tickets .	-8.8860
And last but not least , you need a seat .	-7.3843
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you get on the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-6.1177
A button for electronic evaluation will appear with the test customers .	-4.7410
Train attendants will be notified on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-3.7623
When the train attendant comes to seat Y during the ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already devalued online ticket .	-6.6367
So you can continue to sleep , work , keep quiet .	-4.8597
Check-in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers .	-4.1349
" If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew , check in at DB Navigator .	-5.5244
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time on the train , " says Michael Peterson , DB 's Marketing Board .	-4.7830
Second Plus : " And our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.8407
If you are travelling by train , you will be aware that , in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket controls are one of the biggest annoyances .	-8.0074
Because often you have , but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documentation you need to republish online tickets .	-7.6053
Either the credit card or ID card is missing or a document must be presented .	-6.2564
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or greater area and delays in the control of your own ticket , and ultimately takes the time for conductors to take care of other concerns .	-7.3482
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.3601
And this also only on the trains ICE 915 Dortmund-uttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-3.8338
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet activated .	-3.5589
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Which Streets ? "	-3.1451
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.5821
Just a day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis born sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone .	-5.1026
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school .	-2.4673
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street , " they said .	-3.0475
Confused because nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.1463
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-2.8735
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson , Mo .	-4.4217
He postulated an image of Brown ’ s lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .	-4.1519
" That is wild " , Ferrell thought .	-2.7724
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.9853
She dropped her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-4.3787
There were photos of the police band and people shouting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father bearing a sign saying : ' Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! '	-4.5478
She watched a live feed , where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a smiling dog .	-3.6660
In another video , she said , another policeman fired his gun and shouted : " I 'll kill you ... animals all . "	-4.4627
" This is not usual , " Ferrell recalled her statement .	-3.2014
'This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical ' .	-3.6508
At this moment I felt chills .	-1.5758
I was furious and crying . '	-2.1281
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-2.1426
After landing at 11 p.m. , she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-5.2149
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11th .	-5.3512
It is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , of power and of resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.4619
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter wearing a flower dress and a fitting crown , they talked about a conversation that they had » about the black experience and the black state <unk> countless times before this morning .	-5.2883
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.9915
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it was not right .	-3.1619
I could not take them with me , " Ferrell said later .	-2.4781
" What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past .	-2.4526
She must know it and see it and be brought up in it .	-3.3896
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-9.1665
Although I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black child .	-7.6603
I have the feeling that I would do her a disservice to keeping her away from it . '	-4.5809
The first station , when she arrived in Ferguson , was on South Florissant Road , a location opposite the police office , which became a camp site when activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson .	-6.9424
It was there that Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch .	-4.6003
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters .	-2.5639
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-2.3793
" My activism changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri St .	-4.8068
" I had no experience organizing .	-1.8991
Everything has come . '	-1.6505
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.5101
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.1313
One question was raised by Ferrell : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.9258
This skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people , often whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-4.2850
As Folayan said recently in an interview : ' We had heard people born and raised in Ferguson not center their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.8895
Folayan had already worked with co-director Damon Davis , an artist known for his activism around death penalty inmates .	-4.0402
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals , followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-6.2756
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us , " Davis said .	-3.8889
" That was the main thing for me , how these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented . "	-5.2113
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a messiah leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.0741
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-3.3707
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.6589
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people . "	-3.9121
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement .	-2.6407
Two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.8327
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.5228
Black gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.1921
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-3.0193
She insists , however , that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.9855
" She was the person who shook up this energy , " she said .	-2.5078
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the front line because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman so much is at stake .	-4.3823
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.0548
In the meantime the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue .	-4.2166
Ferrell is suspended for 2 <unk> years due to the blocking of a motorway during a demonstration .	-3.0034
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A Chaos " .	-2.7662
However , she clings to a song and feels bound to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-8.6430
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.1111
It is our duty to win .	-0.9678
We must love and support each other .	-1.5062
We have nothing to lose except our chains . '	-2.0171
From " Dream " to " Sizzling " : TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery .	-4.5018
The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built yet .	-2.7744
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-7.1660
The subject hardly gets cold .	-3.9629
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.7091
While some say to the bit-gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " It would be really great " ( Nicole Schauststen ) , the other side comes up with : " Do not need a man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " sizing mania ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.7051
While proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , the rest of the shops profit from it , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out .	-6.3136
In addition , the gallery is planned on the site where the Bauernmarkthalle is located , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.9126
The start of the construction work will stop there .	-4.2221
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside .	-5.3314
Simone Zimmer : " We have been buying almost weekly in the Bauernmarkhalle for many years .	-4.8851
Our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the housewives , are always very popular .	-6.5019
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves .	-2.9399
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-4.6179
There are other cities as well .	-3.2675
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting . "	-5.0509
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery matters to the level of the rent .	-8.3873
This should not be very low for the new project . '	-4.6107
Eva Kilic : " Why shop in Bitburg ?	-1.8136
Be it clothing , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets , I find that unnecessary .	-4.1021
There is enough of this in our city .	-3.1692
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.3688
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained .	-4.7469
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive .	-5.6421
As you can see , stores in a shopping center are rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-6.0234
It is a pity that there are almost no special deals , and what is left of them will probably disappear . '	-6.3048
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall doesn 't fit together for me .	-3.4758
And the gallery doesn 't fit to Bitburg .	-1.8553
Above all : Where is the Bauernmarkthalle to go during the construction period ?	-5.6698
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the bit gallery actually comes .	-3.9422
Or does the spectre of the Bit-Gallery manage to sell all business out of Bitburg before ? '	-5.4205
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-2.4117
And a shopping centre that is empty does not need anyone .	-3.8448
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .	-3.3910
But there is no room for a farmer 's market hall thanks to the enormous amount of - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-6.8748
If the farmers ' market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-5.6232
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mannings DNA .	-2.1880
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-3.8821
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuckers and Haircuts , which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-4.3444
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35 year sentence after publishing diplomatic messages classified as secret about the WikiLeaks website .	-5.8929
The new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A fitting similarity ) .         e e e e	-5.9221
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a Transwife and pioneering dissident , whose conviction was commuted to Barack Obama when he was only three days in office .	-5.5495
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning , from which 30 portraits were created , how someone might look like with these genomic data , has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual , commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.6939
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , who has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the espionage law , computer fraud , and theft .	-5.0961
Her image was suppressed by the prison , so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy , black-white Selfie , in which Manning visibly sits on a driver 's seat and carries a platinblond wig - with which she was associated .	-7.1670
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg saw the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions .	-3.7478
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumbles and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like .	-4.6771
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.5717
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.2326
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.6734
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal friends of letters who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-3.8899
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanango , which anticipated a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person .	-5.2162
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , he would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .	-4.9134
There is also a little low and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to correct .	-5.5562
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a given reason " .	-3.1488
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning , with its oversized signature below it ( the " i " in her family name has a heart ) , called for an end to the " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which was sex , race , sexuality and culture . "	-6.1395
On the opposite wall , their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-4.2652
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist ) how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.4410
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose 2007 video work , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-5.2638
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . "	-2.8293
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .	-4.4481
She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong .	-5.3554
" When they cold your speech , they won , " it says .	-4.2542
" So never stop talking " .	-3.6752
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who salutes from Philadelphia .	-3.6420
" I still get goose bumps when I talk about it . "	-2.6446
Manning has not seen the exhibition in person yet - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do so , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own genomic simulacrums , which coalesce like hordes of protesters .	-5.6424
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Stater ) , in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-5.3845
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg from portraits .	-2.9875
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind their liberation . "	-3.9404
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for killing .	-3.9471
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are sought after as suspects after a man had been stabbed with deadly injuries in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .	-4.7647
On Monday , warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trent H. James Cornell-Duranleu , as the files of the Cook County Local Court show .	-4.6958
The documents say that Cornell-Duranlea , 26 , died after several stitches .	-3.3644
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on July 27 .	-3.8522
Officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.2495
Cornell-Duranleu was declared dead in the scene , and detectives investigate the plots as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two suspects , officials said .	-5.1491
Since 2007 , Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University .	-2.7650
Alan K. Cubbage , the vice president for university relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been certified and has been barred from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-4.9748
" This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.3431
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.7262
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible ' .	-5.6102
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .	-4.0123
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office , Anthony Guglielmi , said he urged the suspects to face up to the authorities .	-3.3999
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them intensify , " Guglielmi said .	-3.0541
Guglielmi said that local , regional , and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-2.0286
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-7.6937
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.1885
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.6795
It was confirmed by security cameras that Latem and Warren were in the building .	-2.2561
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " Guglielmi said .	-1.8710
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to the residents : ' The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . '	-4.7783
" We will complete the WADA road map in the near future " - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko	-4.2671
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.1730
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road map , RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-8.8229
The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-3.8298
PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for resetting RUSADA and recently published on the organization 's website .	-4.6199
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia .	-3.0183
" Everything was announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.3044
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.6654
However , one of the criteria in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.4725
As far as the matter is concerned , Mutko said : ' We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-3.9829
All measures have been implemented .	-1.4270
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-3.4796
Mutko ’ s words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission .	-3.5569
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day Smirnov reported past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.8055
Nobody wants to accept this report unconditionally , " added Smirnov .	-3.0869
In November 2015 , the WADA excluded RUSADA from carrying out doping checks in Russia as a result of the doping scandal .	-4.5545
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.3316
After a visit to Moscow 's headquarters in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving " in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-4.4356
Aldi no longer sells eggs .	-1.9828
This was shared by the corporate groups .	-3.1916
It was a purely precautionary measure , it was stated in the communication that there could be no further adverse effects on health .	-5.7997
From now on , only eggs are expected to be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been negatively tested for anti-lice containing fibre .	-8.3114
Aldi wanted to provide clarity and transparency to its customers .	-4.4433
The Start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber .	-2.9376
Amy Erett wanted to measure the happiness of your employees in your e-commerce start-up , but the polls did not work .	-5.6136
Responses were often vague , unhelpful , or even worse fraudulent .	-4.6401
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.9733
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Erütt , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-6.5543
She called people from outside for help .	-2.2774
A new breed of Human Resources Startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-2.6237
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite management and directly contact the Board of Directors .	-5.4682
" You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to track your health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-9.7596
Erytt said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-4.7530
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can check why .	-5.3793
Companies come to understand that they must remain at the forefront of the workplace culture , so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished .	-5.6494
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.4486
The global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in value in 2020 , according to the finance website Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.6315
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , discredited a rising interest and activity earlier this year in the midst of Uber everything .	-4.5719
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.9520
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-2.0268
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-4.4780
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.2523
And if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.4845
" The court of public opinion has captured regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-3.5289
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or is unethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer loyalty , worker recruitment , and complaints , Quinlan said .	-5.7427
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .	-5.1152
Previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email to the company headquarters , file a formal complaint , and hope that he was taken seriously .	-8.4208
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesday 's General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to track staff complaints .	-3.8824
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment , or unfair practices , can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-5.1727
" I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who leads Ruby Tuesday 's Risk Management Group .	-5.0798
'And we protect our shareholders from litigation in employment ' .	-3.2748
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to the Enron scandal ’ s ethical violations , according to Quinlan .	-4.5538
But it took the " social media to come to justice " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-4.3610
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.4738
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products .	-3.7087
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the agreement of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups .	-3.7692
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-3.5200
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total financing to $ 60 million .	-3.1436
These investments hardly come as a surprise , given the interconnected nature of business , culture , and venture capital .	-5.8770
There is a growing set of research that shows that today ’ s workers expect more from their jobs than they have been .	-10.6142
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-2.1906
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.9926
" If people are happy to be in a company that heard their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.8302
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies do well when employees are involved .	-5.4208
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.1918
The data on employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .	-3.9362
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take measures .	-3.1955
In fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.8833
And if change does not come quickly enough , or at all , it can cause disappointment and discourage employees .	-4.4197
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on data collection .	-5.0974
" Because if you do not follow , employees will ask , " Do you really hear me ?	-3.7178
Are you concerned about this ?	-1.7538
And who do not care about it , why should I ? '	-3.1417
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly staff surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about glint , so exclaimed .	-4.7481
And after receiving feedback from frustrated employees , the speed of decision making and the quality of communication enabled it to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-5.6530
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is constantly gaining new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.9568
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.4752
" And if you lose people , you lose customers too .	-1.7073
And if you lose customers , you will lose business .	-2.1035
NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-3.3795
It goes to 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA team players are talking on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .	-6.4929
Some have pulled out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-3.5387
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-2.7692
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Aquarius Football Center at 6 : 30 a.m. the next morning .	-5.1282
" This is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-4.5327
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.0361
Therefore , the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 19 : 15 to meet the players ' schedules .	-6.0050
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras carried out six times of practice in Westwood .	-5.7027
They are expected to perform 18 exercises during August , 20 before formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-6.1280
Mora said that he supports NCAA ’ s rule change , even if it adds another point to players ’ busy routes .	-4.8255
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-7.4957
" And they just pushed it through , they continue to ploy , they are great people .	-5.1294
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . '	-3.8318
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which , given the clear lines of sight of its fields , will be no easy task from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , a superior class hotel already equipped with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a gate .	-7.7682
Bruinst players are expected to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are available during the season .	-4.0973
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.9170
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise there .	-4.4883
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite a good business .	-2.8617
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking lot 8 .	-2.7127
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.8250
I am not very concerned about this .	-3.0316
We have a plan . '	-0.9304
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against fake news .	-3.6412
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third party fact-auditors and then display their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-7.0104
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and to send them to invoice auditors who may display the results of the factual examination from the original article .	-7.2024
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-3.8569
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters awash with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings , as they did before the September elections .	-5.4024
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands , and Germany a test of the new invoice review will be launched .	-4.3263
" In addition to recognizing which stories are challenged by fact-checkers from third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.7603
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages .	-4.0987
Create a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England .	-2.5734
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-4.4051
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaaid Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents .	-5.1411
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says humbly .	-3.8150
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands ' .	-2.0612
A Castle in England spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-4.0232
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotional .	-3.3311
" I only reacted to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-4.2131
" This is his thumb print !	-2.5750
And letters always smells of smoke , because at that time a fire was lit because of light .	-4.3845
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .	-3.8047
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.7062
For someone who has been beaten with old papers so that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest : I have somewhat overrated my welcome greeting " ) , all this seems too nice to be true .	-6.6904
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the assembled hymen heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the moat .	-6.0187
He traveled through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape guards , gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-5.8765
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-1.5416
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was not fully accessible until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-4.1462
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the attic " .	-4.8638
Tagaries , letters from the English Empire , maps representing who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch that two families fought for .	-6.3350
Guys , let everything go his way ! "	-2.9556
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for a more comprehensive exploration of English history , including ' The Labourer ' , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381 .	-6.3450
" There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.2673
" The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-2.7550
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-2.6143
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit patron , who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .	-5.0245
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin of stones ( a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.1259
The Darrells are Rhodes 's favorite Scotney family : " The lords seemed to be pretty crooks , repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-5.5507
Other generations of Darrel men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys , with a talent to recruit heirs . "	-4.1636
After finishing his engagement in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.2933
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki , the site of an early 20th century sanatorium , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-4.7657
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-2.9933
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.2922
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the damn life again ' .	-4.0876
Campaign started : Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf wrapped up .	-4.6389
On Friday , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Thursday ’ s round show ) with the unveiling of the 301 year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf .	-6.6544
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.6654
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth .	-3.4993
" Too good for us .	-1.3562
" , ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-5.6871
" We don 't really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their yesterday released website .	-6.5203
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.6417
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem .	-2.6850
Basically , we firmly believe that we as Bad Honnefer citizens are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.2910
The campaign is about more than just a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-6.4054
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition " .	-5.3560
After all , they compete with other communities .	-2.2703
The city of Bad Honnef can cost an average five-digit amount of its new umbrella brand and campaign .	-6.0610
Military Reform in Turkey – Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-2.1569
Every year in Ankara at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and promotion in the officer corps .	-4.7372
This is also the case this week .	-2.8798
At first glance a normal process .	-2.1281
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.5808
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as it used to be , but in the Prime Minister 's office .	-4.6287
The five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs have also taken part in the discussions under the presidency of the Heads of Government .	-5.5935
As a result , civilians in the YAS were in large numbers .	-3.2752
The government is dragging its feet in the military .	-3.0181
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commanders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy have been deposed .	-5.2040
Since the failed coup , Erdo<unk>an has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-1.9180
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army , mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exiled mediator , Fethullah Gülen , whom Erdo<unk>an sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt .	-5.2812
There have been negotiations in Ankara this week against 486 people who have been directly involved in the attempted coup .	-4.3521
Even the day after the coup , Erdo<unk>an had called the coup attempt a " gift of God " , giving him the opportunity to " clean up " the armed forces completely .	-5.8331
But has Erdogan really got the army under control ?	-2.3240
At the end of February the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Uneasiness at the Military Headquarters " .	-5.2061
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing " Islamization " of the army , manifested in , among other things , the lifting of the ban on the headscarf for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-5.4737
In any case , the big cleaning up of the army and the security forces continues .	-5.0139
In mid-July , Erdo<unk>an ordered another 7395 civil servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-2.8719
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military .	-3.1179
The generals used to be the true masters of the country .	-2.8154
Three times , they were putting on the basis of their role as guardians of the secular state order .	-5.7833
Following his victory in 2002 , Erdo<unk>an pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reforms .	-4.5886
Former officers say that Erdogan is deliberately pushing for the Islamisation of the armed forces .	-3.7349
In the ' Vocal Europe ' magazine , a unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be ' full of extremists and Salafists ' in a few years ' time .	-4.4706
If that is true , such a development could not leave NATO indifferent .	-7.0316
In any case , after the purges , there is doubt in the alliance about the Turkish army 's readiness to act .	-5.6686
Leaders and operational capabilities are ' weakened ' , say NATO diplomats .	-3.1193
Washington Changing the Green Card Rules	-1.7797
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.0849
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-4.4039
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.4243
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.5201
" This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are spent Green Cards . "	-4.6476
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.6651
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.4271
The Ministry wants to renovate the race track .	-5.5874
Over the past few months we have been arguing about the future of the race track .	-6.2660
Before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the ailing route on which the tourist railway operates .	-6.9468
In order to secure the future of the race track in the long term , construction work on the track will begin this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .	-5.3728
" With the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this connection , which is particularly important for tourism , " declared Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.3947
He put the cost of repairing the line at around EUR 2.5 million .	-4.5355
The country holds 75 % of that sum .	-3.8539
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being finally agreed , explained Sühl .	-5.5989
The Ministry and the Südthuringen Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-4.3346
" The road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " said Sühl .	-4.2792
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-3.2407
The race track shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017 .	-4.8731
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a popular train connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations , especially for tourists .	-4.4534
In the past few months , a pilot operation had tested whether the route would be used by enough people to re-order it in the future .	-6.5670
The track is also very dilapidated in parts   .    .	-5.8403
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried .	-1.9410
Just when you thought that it could not be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report comes up on technological developments in the field of sex robots .	-5.5122
Yes , indeed .	-1.2777
Sex robots are a big deal at the moment .	-2.9103
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.7915
According to Noel Sharkey , professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must start to take their rise seriously .	-3.4125
Customers can choose the robot 's eye color , its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail .	-3.8378
" People are making fun of them , but companies are delivering a lot of them and we will see them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey when publishing his new report .	-5.9408
Modern sex dummies have developed from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-5.1526
The user can also " adapt " his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the robot 's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.0991
But it becomes even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " who would make a stepford-woman look progressive .	-4.3716
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicon skin .	-2.9004
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as shyness .	-3.7186
And then there are the True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex robots with pre-programmed personalities like Frigid Farrah , which gives the impression of shyness and Wild Wendy with an " adventurous " personality .	-5.7628
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible " , announces the website of True Companion .	-4.4862
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-2.6228
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people !	-3.6803
She can be tired , fixated on conversation or she can be " in mood " !	-6.4981
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics , the allusions to rape when one takes a step towards Frigid ( that is to say , repugnant ) Farrah worry one most .	-7.2539
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.6060
" If women can have a vibrator ( sic ) , why can men not have a Roxxxy ? " says the  .  .	-6.3790
But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-3.9284
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-4.2458
Of course , most men will not hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes its growing popularity , they remain on the brink of consumer culture for the time being .	-5.6209
But what leaks out of the peripheral areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.5957
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.6459
There is a certain overlap that this highly developed sex robot appears at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually attacking women .	-5.0384
The most frightening aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the twisting bodies and the suspended eyes , but how realistic this vision is .	-4.7909
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a leap .	-5.9101
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( though with pornstar proportions ) .	-3.4165
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.7666
But , to the point , when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots are not real women .	-3.9368
You cannot separate yourself from your pet or simply walk away .	-3.3816
They have no mediation or a background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-4.3314
In other words , they are pleasing slaves .	-2.5430
Or , to put it another way , in the 2017 jargon : maids	-6.1669
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.6827
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense .	-2.8330
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families .	-2.9725
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival , newspapers in the US provided advice on how to deal with Trump ’ s favorite relatives ’ horror .	-4.0562
We are all supposedly taking action to burst our filter bubbles .	-4.3876
Less noticed has been Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.7287
I mention this because my cousin , a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has worked with the Republicans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .	-3.6596
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.8777
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows her , including the Republican family with which she fought for politics for decades , is suddenly and strangely on the same side .	-4.2476
That is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-5.2161
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the constituent effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .	-3.8986
When we talk about " normalization " and Trump , we are referring to the grim possibility that one day his kittens will no longer repel us .	-5.4352
But there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of wisdom relative to his standards .	-4.8841
Today , I find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s hilarious version of the madman – the car roof dog , which has 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) – both of which , compared to Trump , are indeed considered to be very mild crimes .	-7.2740
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.9267
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York Park carousel , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you do not need caffeine .	-4.8698
The horses are enormous , the fibreglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are snarling and the animals are twisted to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the music is astonishing .	-7.3704
So many clichés about a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.3417
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the subject of Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London .	-5.2380
The Central Park Carousel , however , is still a strangely magical experience , since two years old , an 11-year old and two women can go there during the 40-year period and all have a great time .	-6.9771
If I had been able to assess the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-3.9318
On the other hand , this week in a department store I was forced to rate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get through my credit card .	-4.5268
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compare the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .	-4.5338
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .	-3.9793
The poor woman in the department store was excitingly excitingly excitingly , while I was tired of my five star credit card .	-5.8726
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain .	-3.4948
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.6935
Last year , he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts on his wrists , which , according to the prison authorities , he suffered after a case in his cell .	-4.7736
Pistorius was sentenced for murder following a public prosecutors ' appeal against a first death sentence .	-4.4695
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine ’ s Day in 2013 by shooting her on several occasions through a door in his house in Pretoria .	-5.4841
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin .	-3.6642
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against the six-year sentence of Pistorius , who they say is too lenient .	-4.1959
The National Prosecution Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-4.0995
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if prosecutors succeed .	-3.4184
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.8717
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg	-1.7153
As the last of the Blumberger schools , the Viertkrissler were made redundant from Fützen and Epfenhofen in their holidays and secondary schools .	-8.7927
Three of the unloading students will go to high school in the future , four to the secondary school .	-5.9947
On Tuesday evening , the head of the school Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biepeval in Epfenhofen .	-5.0587
As a symbol of the school dismissal , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken yard but is then released into freedom .	-6.0288
A musical entitled " Der Adler im Hülhof auf " was performed by the lively Schar .	-7.3797
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it be broached by his hens .	-3.2904
Instead of a chicken kiss , a small eagle came out .	-3.0612
But the hope of turning him into a chicken was shattered , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and decided to do so .	-6.9665
After that , the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the setting of Yvonne Frank .	-5.2684
The hens danced with the young gowns , the cylinders wore to bet .	-4.2349
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-3.3900
Although the kitten is different from the other kittens , it is one of them .	-4.6307
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.5770
His purpose is to be free .	-2.3739
She wanted every four grader to feel accepted in his new school .	-4.7243
It was followed by thanks to the colleagues , the former schoolmaster Michael Müller , who repeatedly skips in school passes , and the parents ' representatives .	-7.6035
The Küchenzeit is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.7202
They leave their students very reluctant after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .	-4.9870
Finally , she was able to rely on the four graders .	-4.8672
Finally , all students had a song of summertime and holiday time .	-4.6876
Great joy broke out among the children .	-3.9601
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year .	-3.5551
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.7785
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .	-3.5066
On the morning of 1 August a group of illegal people was arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.5155
On the same day , they were released while an investigation is under way .	-2.7299
The Foreign Ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.4762
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are imposing heavy fines on anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.6698
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.0937
The ministry said that the court could fine .	-2.6765
Software updates for diesel vehicles : What the people concerned need to know now .	-4.1172
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.7511
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the campaign ?	-2.8425
Overview of the most important questions and answers .	-1.7200
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.4637
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-4.8583
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-2.6221
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates :	-2.1266
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.2825
No , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .	-1.4442
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have Schummelsoftware , " says Anja Smetanin .	-4.7640
The German Federal Ministry of Transport ( KBA ) has ordered their retrofitting .	-5.2873
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.0995
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet given a precise date .	-4.4701
Daimler has informed everyone concerned to register .	-4.4654
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be carried out within the framework of it .	-7.3767
How long will the overall conversion process take ?	-4.9057
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin .	-2.4364
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure .	-3.2897
'For we have seen that car manufacturers have so far not voluntarily acted on the issue of the environment ' .	-5.8809
How long should the update take ?	-1.7015
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.5268
It may be more time consuming to get an appointment .	-3.1617
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?	-2.7935
The ACE advises you to wait .	-1.4393
Foreign producers would probably follow suit , Smetanin said .	-3.7584
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars ?	-3.5649
The ACE fears this .	-2.5795
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten .	-3.6619
In rural areas , there have been no loss of value for older diesel engines .	-7.0834
The ACE advises to wait for a sale .	-2.8108
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award	-2.0701
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.2477
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.8842
One of the winners does not want to come - in protest .	-2.6437
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious awards from the Kennedy Center .	-2.0445
This year , as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , choreographer Carmen de Lavella ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the honored .	-4.5816
The awards will be presented in early December .	-1.6017
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife , Melania .	-3.6088
Lear , the winner of progressive TV series , announced that he would not participate in the gala .	-5.6871
He said to the New York Times : ' This Presidency has decided to completely disregard the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that is a burden on me ' .	-5.7945
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear .	-3.5042
The Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.2862
Former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-1.9875
Making the City livable	-4.5751
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s master builder , will retire next year .	-2.9867
The job is already advertised - however , suitable candidates are rare .	-3.6577
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years .	-2.6446
And his work is still a lot of fun , as he communicates in a press conversation .	-5.2737
He reports on varied but demanding tasks waiting for his successor .	-3.7399
At the same time he is surprised that no application has fulfilled the requirements profile .	-4.0515
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the earliest opportunity .	-3.8593
Therefore , while respecting the regular periods of notice , there should be enough time for a training .	-7.2448
Since Haslach acts as a sub-body of construction law for the administrative community , the applicant has to present appropriate degrees .	-6.5220
The city wants to retain this function .	-4.1357
If they were no longer able to fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.5992
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself , says Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens .	-6.4620
In more than 30 years in office , Wacker has accumulated a number of important projects that Wacker is proud of .	-8.4879
" We make the city livable " , he is sure of himself and his staff .	-5.1665
In the future , however , diverse projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , is under way .	-6.0835
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated , and the stadium reconstruction is still under way .	-5.0767
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros , " if we do it right , " Wacker estimates .	-5.1376
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.4647
The work here is fun . '	-1.9730
There is plenty of room for a master builder .	-4.5226
Haslach ’ s own farm and garden shop can respond to many things very flexibly .	-6.0211
" You can move a lot " , according to Wacker , and the design of green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-4.5666
Since the old town is classified as a monument , it is important to have " an eye for what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city builder emphasises .	-6.6715
In any case , the city builder bears great responsibility .	-5.6508
He is builder , " at the end everything runs over my table " .	-3.9699
He can count on many years of staff in the field of support and coordination : Markus Neumayer ( construction ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .	-7.2186
In addition , Wacker wants his successor to stay a long time : " We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified with the job " .	-6.1619
For continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-3.7289
If you want to succeed Roland Wacker , you should have a degree in engineering or a Bachelor ’ s degree in architecture , according to the town of Haslach , and you have a good knowledge of construction and construction law .	-8.9794
The City Building Office is subject to construction and civil engineering , building management planning , basic economic matters , administration of urban properties , the municipal farm with the building yard and the municipal nursery , as well as the Untere Baurechtsgesamt ( Untere Baurechtsgesamt ) , including monument protection .	-12.3479
Rad thrown on wire : South railway closed .	-6.4959
According to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway tracks in the area of Leobener Strasse ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-5.9853
These were damaged so much that the moving freight train had to be stopped .	-3.9816
The investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours .	-4.4681
Near the scene a pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses .	-4.0370
" This goes far beyond a " Lausbu " fight , said <unk>BB-speaker Christoph Posch to APA .	-7.1683
The perpetrator or perpetrator would have put himself at great risk and also put rail traffic at risk .	-5.4991
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the minutes of delay and the costs of rail replacement , the railway customers may also be able to access the perpetrators .	-8.0020
Overall , the speaker said , a ' substantial ' sum should be assumed .	-6.0352
The damage was again fixed on Friday afternoon , and rail traffic on the southern route could be handled without any obstacles .	-7.8218
Nearly ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning , two of which concerned long-distance traffic .	-5.2758
Freight trains did not stop , but they were delayed .	-2.4669
According to <unk>BB-spokesperson Christoph Posch , there had to be a replacement of some 200 meters of overhead lines .  e	-6.6925
Insulators and masts were also damaged .	-1.7789
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help alleviate IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease ) .	-2.7731
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.4030
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowels .	-3.6174
The incurable state , which affects some 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach cramps and bubbles , recurring or bloody diarrhoea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-4.4059
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant bowel .	-4.2268
The chief researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells are patrolling the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body .	-8.9963
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-2.6540
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bowel disease .	-7.6075
Experiments found that a type of tolerance supporting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their branches .	-4.7529
And the bacterium needs tryptophan , one of the building blocks of proteins , to trigger the cell 's appearance .	-3.2773
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a type of bacteria - lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microorganism , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.9855
The more tryptophan had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells .	-3.0425
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory bowel milieus when the same system also works in humans .	-4.7441
Postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was kept separately , did not .	-4.7974
It assumed that the difference was with the intestinal microorganisms of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-5.2980
The mice ’ demons were sequenced DNA , and six types of bacteria were found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them were absent from the mice .	-5.6176
Mäus were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a microintestine and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-6.9162
In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice .	-5.3578
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .	-3.1520
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid .	-4.0506
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.9569
Dr. Cervantes explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract .	-2.6929
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but genes defects related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowels .	-4.3727
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.4316
In the presence of L. reuteri , high tryptophan values can potentially lead to an expansion of this population . "	-4.1656
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-2.3521
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mourinho believes after the midfield player made his debut against Sampedoria on Wednesday evening .	-4.2926
Chelsea ’ s 40 million pound signature began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched as they wanted .	-6.2331
But Matic had been excluded from the Blues ’ s preparatory Asia tour and only managed 45 minutes , admitting that he had to improve before the Premier League season began .	-6.1810
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-2.2728
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later ' .	-2.1589
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season .	-6.2186
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to fulfill three of its four priority commitments .	-4.8019
" To get three out of four , for which I thank the association , " he added .	-2.7824
" I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken a great deal of trouble . "	-3.8238
Boeing " paints Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.7727
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.5053
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA , which is several thousand kilometers .	-5.7753
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.6336
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner .	-2.3609
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.4606
Boeing had already made such advertising before .	-2.5197
Thus the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .	-2.7276
A New Low for Martin Schulz - Hanover , We have a Problem	-4.2322
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was SPD leader , Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-4.9907
If there were no spoilers from the party headquarters , but no headwinds from the federal government , that was the election ’ s main wish .	-8.7531
Since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.5712
Since then , the Willy-Brandt-Haus employees have watched with increasing horror the events in the SPD-ruled capitals .	-5.3625
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds .	-3.9550
They were deep hits .	-3.2601
One by one .	-2.5194
The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-3.5917
" This shows once again : Red Greens simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.9207
The surprise of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.9522
Five months before the state election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.5762
The Green Federal Managing Director , Michael Kellner , has called on the breakaway Green MEPs of Lower Saxony to return their mandate .	-6.2698
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate .	-3.7511
Elke Tweesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.7738
" That must not be true at all " , a SPD election leader purports , when Friday morning the new Hiobs message reaches the party headquarters .	-9.6031
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is without a government majority after the transition of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU .	-6.1225
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional federations .	-4.2004
And no one knows what comes next .	-2.0743
The misery began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-4.2067
A blue eye , no more , the comrades calmed down at the time .	-3.6844
After the federal elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different .	-2.9896
That became the case - and it became much worse .	-4.4859
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the cold , and the Düsseldorf-Pleite smoothly reversed the party .	-5.2023
In the weeks after that , the comrades complained again .	-7.1245
Then , when they had just seized new courage , came the G-20 summit in Hamburg .	-3.9189
And with him came the next deep blow .	-2.1844
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD head of state , lost his coach that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.9428
And because he then made almost everything wrong in crisis communication that can be done wrong .	-4.3424
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-2.0491
Now also Stephan Weil .	-1.9062
The Dutch Prime Minister has been critical for some time because of the Volkswagen exhaust gases affair and its role in the Supervisory Board .	-6.4052
Miuse survey values were added .	-4.1848
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Weil has tried increasingly in recent weeks to place emphasis in the federal context .	-7.2773
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to increase his power in Berlin did not hide comrades around Martin Schulz .	-4.9846
They allowed him to grant him because they promised to stabilize the party .	-4.8299
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.9950
It is because the Dutch Greens are not really to blame for the partisan conflict .	-7.4384
And Schulz certainly not .	-2.8848
For the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.7053
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and particularly at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten .	-4.4906
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of all others , " says Matthias Miencsch , leader of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-6.3921
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the list of countries of the Lower Saxony Greens , according to the Dutch Member .	-7.1171
The logical consequence would be to give back its mandate .	-2.9267
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , complains about an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.6455
" The voters ' will four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil the prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Saxon SPD as the top candidate for the federal election , the RND .	-5.9263
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result , " said Oppermann .	-4.4596
He asked to clarify the background .	-2.9507
I would like to know whether there has been more of this or whether there have been further promises from the CDU of Lower Saxony .	-5.0475
Aid to the centre of III	-3.5113
Anyone who wants to renovate his house over the years can soon get support from the country .	-4.9516
On Wednesday , Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG informed the city of the city at the Empfingen .	-5.8051
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler gave a review of what happened so far .	-4.4142
Since 1991 there have been redevelopment areas in Empfingen .	-3.5355
Back then , in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg took over two-thirds of the funding .	-5.3054
In the II redevelopment area from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was 60 % .	-4.9750
For Schindler the previous renovations are a " success project " - it is important to promote internal development as well , and not only to open up new areas of construction .	-5.9692
On April 4 , the Governing Council of Karlsruhe informed us that there will be a redevelopment area III .	-5.3209
The total amount was 833 333 euros , of which 500 000 would come from the country , the rest from the municipality of Empfingen .	-5.5906
How is a recovery area created ?	-3.8775
They will continue to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-4.5875
There is also a role to play , however , as to whether there is any interest in renovating the planned area .	-7.9780
If necessary , the territorial boundaries could be shifted again .	-5.1873
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-2.3367
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Country program " Social City " , in which the renovations would then be carried out .	-3.8034
At the heart of the programme are the revitalization of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-5.0499
The measures would be carried out on an objective basis , i.e. per plot .	-5.0852
The rehabilitation area would then be laid down as a statute .	-3.5883
The funding allocation period has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-4.5350
By September of this year , however , we would first have to take stock of the situation in which those involved in the recovery area will receive a questionnaire to fill out .	-7.6828
In November or December , if possible , the motion for a resolution should be adopted so that the rehabilitation can begin next year .	-6.1536
Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .	-3.8984
It is a question of assessing the urban problems and deciding when to remedy them and to what extent .	-5.4714
There will also be a reclamation notice in the land registry for the respective property .	-7.1356
Pietzschmann himself would come to Empfingen again and take a look at the situation , she promised .	-4.1369
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-4.2213
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-5.5757
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land sheet " , which covers , among other things , the construction state and the recovery intentions .	-6.7057
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and flat sheet " , information about the size , division and inhabitants of a living room can be provided .	-5.3411
The blue " operational sheet " is to be filled only if business premises are operated in the building .	-4.3734
However , Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding .	-3.0375
In addition , new construction measures are not eligible .	-3.3432
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds works according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first , grinds first .	-6.7841
You cannot " reserve " funds for later .	-4.7766
Finally , photos of the project " Innenstadt II " were shown in order to " sell " a rehabilitation to those present .	-7.4275
British inventors are using a microchip to get home and car with a hand movement .	-5.0314
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.9820
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and forefinger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-3.6435
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory nurse at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-4.8929
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-2.9156
The Northam company also wants to change the locks in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of $ 300 per lock .	-4.8632
The married father of one has now incorporated both at home and his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is in the wheel .	-4.9527
The White House ’ s advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands .	-5.1920
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24.000 , according to the military , which was handed over to TIME magazine .	-4.9658
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event at the White House on 17 July with American construction programs .	-4.2301
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states .	-3.2400
The Connecticut helicopter was issued alongside a Maine yacht , a Wisconsin fireman and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-5.6809
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary or FRAGO order , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , according to the record of Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the helicopter ’ s operation .	-6.1142
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.3634
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on July 17 at 3 p.m. and remained until the pitch was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.8600
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restrictions on service hours .	-5.0907
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the unit ’ s security personnel remained on the ground during the time .	-4.9092
It was not clear from the records provided by TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .	-4.2569
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.4016
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-3.8361
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the hatch act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.5975
" Sounds as if you were locked , " the deputy commander replied .	-2.5295
The " Made in America " event was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-3.3117
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.3625
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb government legislation .	-9.0981
The use of the aircraft , known as the Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-7.8682
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip .	-2.4315
But asking for their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .	-2.8955
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential plane .	-4.7048
" The White House is thrilled by the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers using American materials , " said the Deputy White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters .	-4.0894
HMS 1 crews frequently conduct training flights around Washington and South Lawn to remove the US president from the White House with precise centimeters .	-5.6891
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House .	-3.4789
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-2.8638
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for " non-presidency support missions " .	-3.6213
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other requisites presented at the event .	-3.5919
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on South Lawn .	-3.4564
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-4.3882
However , according to the US Department of Defense ’ s hourly tariff for the 2017 fiscal year , the US Department of Defense ’ s D reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is US $ 24.380 per flight hour .	-6.1284
The unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico , Virginia .	-4.3398
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .	-3.2228
'Determining the cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading , ' said Walters .	-4.8316
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget ' .	-3.3339
According to a 2015 RAND study , the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-4.4113
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-3.4443
" The idea is to present things that are made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.7167
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , depend on it .	-3.0170
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.1963
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-3.3361
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his South Lawn tour for the event , but he sat in the driving seat of a fire car .	-4.6903
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-3.6672
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.3540
TC BW Neuss Before Knitting	-3.9121
The German Tennis Federation is the leader of the second German Tennis League .	-9.3352
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will perform tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third table searchsdorfer SV .	-5.5393
In spite of five games still a flawless record , the leader of the Second Federal League of Tennis has maintained the sense of reality .	-6.3631
Team boss Marius Zay has a respect for the opponent .	-4.8404
" This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation .	-3.3504
Especially on the back positions I find the team very good . '	-3.9303
For the SV Suchsdorf class and stability , imports from the high north are the main concerns .	-7.9572
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis-Cup .	-3.5418
And they are also strong in doubles , " says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Gleurus ( all Denmark ) .	-4.7420
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-2.7032
You also need good luck . '	-5.2171
The new team for the trip to the high north stands practically .	-3.7654
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier .	-2.8200
If the Frenchman still active at the Challenge tournament in Biella , Italy , does not make it to the Bundesliga match , Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) , who plays in the Czech Republic during the tournament , will win his first bet this season .	-9.0122
The so far unconquered Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarus Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel .	-5.6869
He was to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandulp , Niels Lootcsma ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-4.6305
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máté Valkusz could join the team again .	-4.0938
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary , which was the number one junior world ranking in January 2016 , someone from the coaching club around Marius Zay is filling the ladder .	-6.6898
How America Can Damage OMV	-2.2096
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law on tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .	-4.1963
" In his haste to enact the law , " Congress packed in a few " unconstitutional rules " , he testified .	-5.2524
The reaction from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US move .	-6.5066
After all , the proposal provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.9211
Since then , investors from the local OMV have been similarly worried , which , together with other European companies , is co-funding the construction of the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea pipeline in Russia .	-8.6829
The threatening backdrop is huge .	-2.8790
Yet it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the oil company ’ s official statement .	-3.4170
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life via an executive order .	-4.4240
Twelve weapons are at his disposal .	-2.6699
" The press " looked at which the company could turn off and which could really hurt it .	-5.8862
Narcos Season 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel is brought to the fore in the hit series of Netflix .	-4.0266
Despite the second season of Narcos , which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.5567
The three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad guys of the show .	-4.1155
In the third season , DEA focused its attention on the richest organization in the world of drug trafficking : the Cali party .	-5.0575
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribes and violent actions .	-3.3805
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.5701
In the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<unk>a , the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs .	-7.3536
Other new actors are Matias Varela , Michael Stahl-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-2.0232

Rolle backwards : the city employs 46 kitchen aids .	-3.8553
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself .	-3.4498
With permanent contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .	-4.5268
The clock is rotated back in the municipal nursery schools .	-4.3251
As of 1 September , the city of Krefeld will take over the food care in the municipal children 's day facilities ( Kitas ) .	-6.8625
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director of the Department of Youth Aid , this is good news : " We were all very pleased " .	-3.9480
A caterer takes care of this task and supplies freshly cooked food chilled .	-6.0166
The city operates 46 daycare centres in Krefeld , in 44 children receive a warm meal at midday .	-4.8863
In the past kitajas , there were 2800 children at the tables , and demand is growing steadily .	-7.2589
" Meanwhile , not only do children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat at the Kita for lunch , " explains Pommeranz .	-5.3507
" The offer is also valid for the 35-hour service if children stay until 2 p.m. " .	-5.4042
As of 1 September , 46 part-time workers have a kitchen service : they warm the food delivered , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , individually port the meal , give off the food , clean the kitchen .	-8.8578
" Employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pomeranian .	-3.8269
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group institutions - determines the amount of hours .	-5.5957
" The kitchen helpers are now part of the Kita team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.0877
" So they are much more involved and it is easier for kitaluting to implement pedagogical concepts " .	-4.2067
That is also the point : healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-6.6766
" The children should help prepare the food " .	-2.8798
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.7360
Also for children .	-2.1412
" They have a known force in the kita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.7437
This continuity is important for children .	-1.5310
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - previously also the responsibility of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel .	-5.2570
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only improved the quality of the kitchen , but also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in comparison with the cost of the city 's own management and the foreign assignment , says the press office .	-9.7737
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited .	-3.3770
" But these hours don 't matter so much at around 750 people in the educational sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.9252
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN	-1.7907
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-1.9039
Nicholas Haysom , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will stand in the provincial council elections , with three women standing for the role of Vice-President , and more than 30 % of newly registered voters being women .	-5.3164
" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said in a statement on Wednesday .	-1.8147
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.5279
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-1.7019
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international combat to an advisory role .	-3.9299
This year , for the first time , the elections will pass power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next .	-4.5292
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan ’ s democratic success .	-5.2658
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million registered voters .	-2.4663

Men Trying to Shoot 13-year-old Girls	-4.1878
On Thursday , two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl .	-3.8211
According to police information , the 13-year-old , who was with friends at the Kolpingstra<unk>e , spoke at around 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl 's mobile phone .	-7.1436
The 13-year-old refused the request and continued with her friends .	-3.0307
One of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl 's cell phone and necklace , which was unfortunate .	-7.0404
The duo escaped without prey .	-2.1562
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-1.7847
The investigation is under way .	-1.7346
GMB Concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.4465
A trade union would like to see McVitie ’ s Bissau ’ s managers make sure that they have a long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow factory .	-9.1226
GMB Scotland said that the company had remained silent about the future of investments in the Tollcross location .	-4.0759
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces , among other products , Hobnos and Rich Tea biscuits .	-4.8261
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <unk> 5 million in recent years .	-3.2547
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be " the first to know " if their activities were to change .	-8.8196
In a letter to the company 's store manager , GMB Scotland McVitie 's asked " to express concern that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being promoted " .	-5.9127
GMB-Senior Organiser Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Suite Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply .	-4.9168
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation .	-4.8850
That is why , from the perspective of jobs , wages , and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , rising cost of living and chronic output decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie . "	-5.9610
A spokeswoman from Pladis said : " The store manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-6.5949
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives on Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-4.6948
We discussed with the staff that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-5.7265
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than <unk> 5 million in our Tollcross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.7229
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production facility , and if our operations at the site change , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-6.0932
Three years ago , did the PSG Barcelona warn against Neymar ?	-3.1433
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-3.1595
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop persecuting Neymar after giving an offer of $ 189 million to trigger his exemption clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record breach ?	-6.0586
The sensational approach has fueled the summer transfer window , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <unk> 89 million last season .	-4.6417
At the end , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world .	-4.4880
Barcelona is furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out , even though a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since he arrived from Santos in 2013 .	-5.3513
But was the PSG president warned the football world of this prospect three years ago ?	-3.0985
When Manchester City declared an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to have one of the best players signed by PSG .	-4.3568
" I 'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.6803
" We respect all clubs .	-0.9853
But if they try to get one of our players signed , that will have consequences . '	-4.1761
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti .	-4.5795
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers to Neymar .	-4.3488

The Touran driver picked up the circuit .	-6.3316
The car caused material damage .	-4.4801
The driver of the opposing car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident .	-3.7437
It can be good , according to the accident victim , that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident .	-4.0241
The police are now asking for evidence of the incident and the driver of the " polluter pays " vehicle to contact the commission in Stolzenau under Tel .	-6.8985
Interview : " Domspatzen Report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger "	-3.6577
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-6.3203
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says .	-2.9868
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Grauburger Domspatzen continues to lead to discussions .	-6.2492
Christian Weisnder , spokesman for the reform movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emergent Pope Benedict XVI .	-6.1786
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of what happened at the time .	-5.0006
The Vatican newspaper ' Osservatore Romano ' , on the other hand , criticised the ' double standards ' used in the reporting of violence in the Domspätzen .	-6.7152
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , no one doubts that they are " shameful and shameful acts " that must be punished and prevented in the future ; but the " degree of media manipulation " is striking , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee .	-6.3242
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider this to be normal , " says Scaraffia .	-4.1420
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk : " You like to go out to the church and that 's a pet .	-6.9488
She also pointed out that in her youth " beatings were a normal pedagogical tool " to cope with naughty children as I was " .	-5.4884
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.4823
In connection with the reports on cases of abuse , Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-4.7459
Quite wrongly , says author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the commemorative book " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-5.0263
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he assesses the results of the final report .	-4.2579
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-5.2584
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspätzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks     .                 e   e	-7.9783
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In summary , it can be noted that , in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been used by Cathedral Master R.	-5.8107
Particularly with high emotionality , punishment for the students could also be more severe .	-4.4087
However , unlike many other defendants , it is apparent that many victims appreciated R. ' s general humanity and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even bring positive memories to him ' .	-7.9115
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he considers the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger to be relieved .	-6.0043
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence in the case of protected persons in the case of the regurger Domspätzen ' gives a contradictory picture of the master of the Cathedral , Georg Ratzinger .	-7.6927
On the one hand , many students emphasize their " humanity " .	-3.3164
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist , who often became tangible when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance .	-6.1256
How do you view this final report as his biographer ?	-2.3660
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it .	-6.2744
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.1355
The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of activity .	-7.5697
He can be accused of being too late or of not being taken seriously enough .	-6.2914
The Domspzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-5.0319
The vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , also has an excellent record , describes him as " warmhearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as a very friendly teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , cookies and sweets and " always surrounded by grapes of children " .	-7.5072
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality , which has led to rage .	-4.3945
He himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he did not just crack with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor , but also pulled the eartags of distributed and overly cheeky boys .	-8.3083
In his honor , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the time in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , both with parents and teachers .	-6.2909
Do you also know such methods of breeding ?	-3.5548
Of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.2932
I , too , experienced this in a secular school , a state high school .	-4.0838
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of pre-school violence , this is , of course , trivial .	-6.6820
One wonders whether it is more likely to be related to his notoriety and role as the brother of Benedikt XVI that a lot of the media has just crashed on him .	-7.4950
Many of those who have never understood him are still eagerly working on the Bavarian Pope .	-4.5365
But the truth is : the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-3.1611
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse in the case of the regurger Domspätzen .	-6.8510
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.3062
Michael Hesemann : Clearly no .	-2.2111
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the master of the Cathedral .	-3.9186
Not even the parents were consecrated .	-1.5856
" I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about this , " said one of them on behalf of the others , " I was very embarrassed " .	-5.4459
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was , and still is , that most victims remain silent out of shame .	-3.5427
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , it would certainly not be a choral conductor who would have been , in a way , a colleague of the perpetrators of es   e .	-9.3112
How do the Domsputter student Ratzinger assess the role in cases of abuse ?	-4.2786
Michael Hesemann : As a student put it : " With regard to sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) could have had timely evidence and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-7.4695
I think ... it is also really absurd to assume that it is he who has been more forceful , clearer or even more open than to her parents , boarding directors , trust teachers , etc .	-9.8420
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable " .	-2.7160
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion : ' It was impossible to confirm that the pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him beforehand ' .	-6.5971
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of any complicity .	-3.5662
In this way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or placed him on display .	-6.2318
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these heinous crimes , as unfortunately has happened in some cases .	-4.2296
In the media , there was much to read about " excesses of violence " in the Regensburg Domspätzen .	-5.9102
The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report " Wegschauen " .	-5.9654
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.9081
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and blended into a huge mélange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere in the middle , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.6598
However , that is precisely the abuse of the report .	-4.6612
There is a clean separation : between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.4888
In addition , the report deals with incidents dating back to 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not head of the choir of the Domspatzen .	-6.0922
All the terrible teaching of caning , the cases in which boys were subjected to severe harassment and maltreatment by sadistic teachers , and suffered terribly as a result , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed .	-7.6666
But the master of the cathedral Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he saw the boys only when they were already at the Domspzengymnasium .	-6.1577
On this , as most witnesses emphasize , the topic " preschool " was taboo .	-3.5310
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and even " paradise " conditions for many .	-4.4671
What was different at the Domspzengymnasium ?	-3.0680
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-3.0310
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims value R. ' s general humanity and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even bring positive memories to him ' .	-6.8374
At most , this leaves the accusation of having looked the other way .	-5.4864
However , despite all the efforts , the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported on the pre-school conditions .	-5.6211
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and did not want to hear anything about what happened at a school where he was not active and responsible ( according to the witness ) , and then again in 1993 .	-6.6238
Is Georg Ratzinger consistently closing his ears before the conditions ?	-3.6145
Michael Hesemann : No , since since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzgymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-4.3988
In this he points out that " caning is still practised in preschool " .	-5.2570
Even in view of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.3658
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity when caning sentences were already banned in Bavaria .	-4.0872
Before that , they were in a legal grey area , as we all know .	-3.7546
It was also difficult for him to assess where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was really exceeded .	-5.8127
Nor can we say that he has always looked the other way .	-3.3265
That is simply not true .	-1.2389
It was not until 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.2476
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to the times .	-4.4434
What do you see ?	-2.1388
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " pitfalls of anachronism " , that is , the danger of judging the past by today 's moral standards .	-4.9412
The princess is right .	-3.0732
But that does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was odious at all times , nor to what was concealed in the preschool of defiance and violence on innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond what was then common practice .	-7.7976
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .	-4.4695
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.8821
His methods of discipline and punishment , in other words , to pull the ear and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-6.5793
When physical punishment was then banned , he also strictly adhered to it .	-4.0191
What kind of picture of his regurger time did Georg Ratzinger play in the conversations with you for the book " My brother the Pope " ?	-6.0568
Did the subject of caning also be mentioned ?	-4.2979
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective that the Domspatzen played only a side role .	-6.6443
Nevertheless , I do not deny that he had a strict regime there .	-4.5310
But this also needs to be said : without this perfectionism , without the demand for absolute discipline , it would have been impossible for him to form a world-class institution from the Regensburger Domspätzen , which was formerly known as a national institution , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-8.2011
With cookies and sweets alone , you make the most of the unruly boys , no big singers and no success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-9.7075
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the discussions on her book ?	-3.7603
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have seen him again and again as wonderful , humorous , fundamental , deeply believing and heartbreaking person , from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything to please even a fly .	-9.2655
I regularly get with how many former Domspätzen keep in regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family , 23 years after his retirement .	-6.0044
Those who , until now , do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.9993
Most of Domspätzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them .	-4.2586
And that he was always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but he was also a kind respected person to whom they still look up today and who they almost worship .	-7.9712
And please , let me make it quite clear once again : everything that is being accused of is educational methods that were on the agenda at the time .	-7.4822
We can be pleased that we have long since gone beyond that time .	-4.2134
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother .	-3.8428
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious .	-3.0074
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-3.0174
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man , who has earned a great deal of merit , should finally be allowed to settle in peace without whom , outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany , no one would know the regurger Domspätzen .	-10.0203
