Good luck : Even more security for pedestrians	-7.6807
The new B 33 pedestrian light was launched in Gutach on Tuesday at the village parking lot - in sight of the older town hall lamp .	-5.2863
Two plants so close to each other : intent or stranglehold ?	-5.0984
Yesterday Gutach 's mayor answered this question clearly .	-3.0545
" The Town Hall lamp was installed at the time because it secures the school path , " Eckert explained yesterday .	-4.7806
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and miners .	-3.9009
The facility , which was officially opened yesterday , is important for the intersection area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-3.7432
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.0587
" At the high traffic and pedestrian volume , another traffic light had to be used for their safety , " said Eckert .	-5.7104
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg council .	-3.1742
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33 , of which approximately 10 percent are heavy goods vehicles , " says Arnold .	-5.4141
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety is just happening here " , says Arnold .	-5.1929
In total , four traffic shows were carried out , a roundabout was also thought out , but because of the narrow edge in the crossroads Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-7.2205
According to Arnold , everything was tested before at the location of the traffic lights : " By means of an extra-long transporter loaded with particularly long timber trunks , we have tested whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbach path to the B 33 without changing the traffic lights ' .	-7.9490
The approximately EUR 15 000 traffic light system itself is the ' most modern thing currently on the market ' , explained Arnold .	-4.2065
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights are well recognized by drivers , for example , even when the sun is deep .	-6.8692
It is also economical : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-4.0586
There are three light systems per journey direction .	-3.0266
Arnold explained the technique of the new system : this is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.7613
Pressing the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-3.3855
If the road is free , comes directly green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.5401
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be finished .	-2.7845
" If a group or people with disabilities go over the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be safe on the road , " said Arnold .	-11.6089
Naturally , the driver must consider this as a partner and observe the road .	-5.1105
This was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic light for pedestrians green , a top class vehicle rushed through - with bright red .	-4.7010
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years .	-2.7828
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - linguistics , the inclination to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the narrow and joyful nature .	-6.4960
The Büchner prize winner is known primarily as a prose author , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-5.0460
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher compiles a collage of prose texts for his performance " weather lights on the tongue tip " , which can now be seen in Garage X at St. Peter 's Square .	-5.0029
The theatre maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographically marked novel " Der Serbiegene " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " corpse , his family stirring " ( 2003 ) .	-5.8565
On the largely empty stage - important requirement : a crushed sofa , on which it appears to be copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material .	-6.4267
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-2.5763
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the template with a wealth of directions , known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms of play .	-5.6089
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic translations .	-4.6167
They are tough touched , dipped with the head under water , with their evening drobes to the wall .	-5.8172
Forced in Zellophan or Mieder , they stake on dangerously high sticks through the staging , either monologize loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor .	-5.7949
However , the text hardly conveys itself in this exhaustive way .	-5.0017
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-3.7141
Only in the end does the overturned performance come to rest , and Winkler 's absurd humor flashes up .	-6.3353
A Blackbox in the Car ?	-1.4178
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system , and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of any car .	-4.9261
The equipment that record every kilometre and report the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system of financing US roads .	-4.3656
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked intense debate with colourful alliances .	-3.1405
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax models .	-5.3718
The Tea Party is horrified .	-1.1555
The American Citizens ' Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.7297
But , while Congress cannot agree on a course of action , several states no longer wait .	-3.7821
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per mile dri.	-4.3793
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.3358
This is really a must for our country .	-1.9756
“ It ’ s not something we will use only possibly , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , CEO of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record the driven miles for all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 onwards .	-5.1902
The way in which we pay these taxes will change .	-1.4687
The technology is there .	-1.5726
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from taxes paid by US Americans on the pillar , is broken .	-4.3522
But America no longer has as much tank as it used to be .	-4.9014
Cars consume less petrol .	-1.5022
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 eurocents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.2597
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a cent at high injection prices .	-3.4138
“ The petrol tax is simply not future-oriented , ” said Lee Munnich , an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.4155
His state recently equiped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.8814
“ This is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-2.9229
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .	-2.4835
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals , because the tax could , for example , be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases .	-4.8806
California ’ s planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state ’ s ambitious , legally enshrined targets on climate change .	-4.5438
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also said that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.0794
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of having drivers pay on a journey back .	-5.6139
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice-President of Directives at Reason .	-2.7055
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.6813
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers who , in a 2011 report , called on Congress to move toward mile-based settlement .	-3.4601
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project involving 10,000 cars .	-2.1776
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of rural MEPs who represent people , who often have many miles on their way to work or to the city in their daily lives .	-5.5590
Nevertheless , several states and cities are moving in that direction on their own .	-3.7297
Oregon is the most committed driver , currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country .	-4.7281
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the oil tax to the state .	-3.3235
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.2514
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-1.8693
Illinois tests it with lorries to a limited extent .	-2.7644
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the eastern coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently investigating how to introduce the change .	-3.2280
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.9875
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of its movements .	-3.4641
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Earnings Management at Nevada ’ s Department of Transport .	-3.6675
People did not want it .	-1.1176
When the test started , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into adult monitoring devices . ”	-4.0634
There is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-3.2218
Nevada is part of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the driven kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-4.4349
So , Khan said , the public would also be more reassured .	-3.7563
Hunting this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.3591
The company was originally not involved in helping states to tax drivers .	-3.9144
Rather , it was their aim to take root in an emerging car insurance market , where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles driven .	-6.0013
However , the devices it tested are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is uploaded regularly by modem .	-11.5782
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-2.8761
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes .	-2.5324
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .	-2.5469
In Oregon , planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices .	-3.5936
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.8339
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat rate fee based on the miles passed on average by all residents of the state .	-5.0263
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by equipping the equipment with more functions than with fewer .	-4.1536
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that can also pay parking fees , pay insurance only for driven kilometres and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can evade congestion .	-5.6021
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” says a city planning document .	-3.3851
However , some transport planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction .	-4.6587
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay , officials said that Congress could solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax .	-3.3352
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they , too , pay a fair share .	-4.2606
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the Commission ’ s Legislative and Public Affairs Director .	-4.2640
If we do , hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things .	-2.5992
Königsfeld : Small team strikes wacker .	-8.8043
The Voluntary Fire Brigade handled its autumn test with bravour despite the lack of staff .	-6.2625
Only eleven men took part in the exercise .	-1.8155
The department commander Hans Kammerer chose the property Feder in Burgberger Stra<unk>e in his exercise assumption .	-10.6586
A short circuit should have been established there when sawing .	-5.1928
Two people were injured by the emerging fire and smoking , one of which was able to send an emergency call .	-4.5477
After Hans Kammerer first examined the situation , two respiratory guards of the army agreed to enter the building .	-5.3121
After a short period of time , the first person was able to find and lead into the open .	-5.3899
The second person had to be worn .	-0.9683
This was not so easy as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome .	-4.1552
The building , a workshop with built-in stable for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-11.3136
It stored a lot of wood and also straw bales .	-3.7155
There were also electrical machines for woodworking .	-3.1821
The first extinction was carried out by the tank in the vehicle .	-10.5337
Another line took place via an overflowing hydrant at about 100 meters distance .	-6.1478
Three extinguishing attacks could now be created .	-4.1700
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building .	-3.5506
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what to do with little available staff .	-4.9319
In the event of an emergency , support is provided by the Königsfeld day-to-day deployment group .	-5.2971
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .	-2.1369
Networking of universities and companies	-1.9327
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald , Landtag President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where tomorrow ’ s workers come from .	-4.9290
In the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum , he worked together with the managing directors of the vocational schools as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the parent advisory board chairman on this important issue .	-5.7294
" Education is an important location factor " , underlined Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald .	-4.1243
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-3.0737
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and Berufsschulzentrum in the Forest City . in the . in in . in in . .	-11.3871
He also praised the family friendliness in the county .	-2.8276
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also , due to demographic change , to the phase of care for families , " Wolf said .	-5.5108
He also stated that more and more employees were concerned with the care and care of their families .	-5.2926
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment , " Wolf said .	-3.8750
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers , he said .	-2.2999
Another important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.7027
" For anyone who has already met the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and skills , often retains the regional economy , contributing to the strengthening of the region , " the President of the Landtag convinced himself .	-6.7744
Because only if adequate training places are offered can skilled workers be met .	-5.0396
In his opinion , the district ’ s location advantage is its favourable location in the south-west of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.3350
In addition , on his railway journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made to expand local public transport .	-4.9201
" Stay persistent and make public transport better , " he said to local politicians present .	-3.7035
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music .	-2.1650
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cake and then to a vesper .	-3.7492
In the past , the elderly were served in the resting place .	-4.1181
Meanwhile , this afternoon is taking place in the nursing home of St. Josef .	-3.8505
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.9096
Later there were sausages salads .	-3.0407
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained conventional melodies .	-3.1814
The 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e is to be replaced with the rehabilitation costs of the city of Bräunlingen .	-6.8098
In the days before the Kilbig a small angle wall , stabilization and static discharge of the natural stone wall with balustrade was installed during the first work of the restoration of the front school court .	-6.7460
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger City Building Office , the National Monument Office is to be included in the planning and a rehabilitation concept for the old wall .	-6.8303
Then a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts , who will then be put on the table to the Council of Communities to decide and determine the way forward .	-7.1310
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year .	-3.5892
After the rehabilitation , pavement and planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 , the subsequent action must be carried out in the foreseeable future , and the restructuring necessary limit wall must be rehabilitated from scratch and placed on new foundations .	-8.8901
The historic , one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e is in need of rehabilitation , mainly due to water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , and has a propensity for arches .	-7.2828
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse .	-3.6778
A steady wall is a prerequisite for a school court used by students , which is carried out by current fortifications .	-15.1648
Originally , schoolyard renovation was even planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift .	-5.1420
The National Monument Office will take part in the historic rehabilitation of the school wall , which has even been used for film recordings .	-6.1091
Should the guidelines come from this side , the town of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument guards .	-5.7258
Students of the Bräunlinger Primary School , who are now teaching with new aula in a well renovated old school building , will soon be able to use the old school court .	-6.4263
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart .	-1.8886
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the Musikhochschulen in Baden-Württemberg , Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has also been involved .	-4.2302
" I think it is wrong to abandon holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music , " said <unk>zdemir , " Stuttgart News " .	-4.0821
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location in Stuttgart .	-3.7466
This contradicts <unk>zdemir , who in Stuttgart is a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September , the Green Red National Government . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-12.8393
On the basis of an expert study , it is forcing a reorganisation of the five musical colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.8432
After that , the Jazz and Pop course will be moved from Stuttgart University to the Musikhochschule Mannheim .	-4.5523
US border : " Super Tunnel " to drug smuggling discovered	-2.8289
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and shut down a ' super tunnel ' for drug smuggling .	-3.1981
As US customs authorities have pointed out , the more than 500 meter long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks and an ventilation system .	-4.5342
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-3.4432
According to the figures , the tunnel had not yet been used .	-3.0592
" These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig through the radar , " said the US District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in San Diego , where it had discovered an end to the tunnel .	-4.9718
Duffy told the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.3412
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels .	-2.2229
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.0403
Constructed by Experts	-1.3465
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year .	-4.3290
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there .	-3.6657
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building 80 metres from the border .	-3.1013
According to the authorities , a leader leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual entrance to the tunnel .	-4.4650
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres in height and 90 centimetres in width .	-2.7646
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States .	-3.4500
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-1.9244
The third , a Mexican , was caught for the seized marijuana .	-2.8062
All three are threatened as a maximum sentence of lifelong detention , as officials have said .	-3.8777
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-4.1461
However , this is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction .	-3.0716
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels .	-2.4368
This demonstrates the " despair " of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have since been cut off , Bill Sherman said of the Drug Research DeA in San Diego .	-5.3897
They would do everything they can to get to the US .	-2.5905
The detainees were not given details , at least one being Mexicans , it was said .	-4.4839
You have to expect prison sentences of up to ten years .	-2.9147
In 2014 , Geisinger Festjahr	-2.2943
The anniversary of the town of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-2.0167
Return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer .	-4.4693
When the year ends in eight weeks , the anniversary year is due .	-4.6357
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned in documents in 794 .	-3.2492
A document was produced in churches where both places are mentioned .	-4.0624
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen does not currently have a hall , this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-5.6995
During the anniversary a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses .	-3.7575
Church houses will be the 1250 in July at a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July .	-4.0865
Return to celebrate .	-2.8168
On Friday with a celebration , on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the Kirchtalhalle .	-10.5666
On this festival weekend is also the church Hausen church festival .	-12.4062
Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed on three dates .	-4.7942
On June 21 , together with the Black Forest Association ’ s Sunwind Celebration , on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-5.2260
It will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date will be on the last weekend of September , 27 and 28 .	-4.4254
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary a new chronicle is also released .	-4.2382
" It should be a chronicle not only by Geisingen himself , but also a printed work on the Geisingen of today , which consists of Geisingen , churches , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , " says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-5.3849
And today ’ s hostage celebrates its birthday in 2014 , and in 1974 today ’ s space with the communities was completed .	-4.9781
The new chronicle will be presented at the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .	-2.9749
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries .	-2.9759
The fool of Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will have the festival banquet on 29 March and will celebrate the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-5.9888
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 May , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates it at the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July .	-5.2139
The town of Geisingen was first documented in 764 in a gift certificate owned by the St. Gallen monastery .	-10.1662
The document was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was then court .	-3.7790
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-2.5242
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014 is that the municipal reform is also 40 years ago .	-6.2545
Council Targets Glass	-4.3745
Should the railway crossing ' Am Hirschen ' be extensively rebuilt in order to increase road safety ?	-4.7313
Yes , the municipal councils decided . . . . . . . . . . . .	-9.0489
It must take EUR 220 000 in the hands of the .	-5.4763
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-3.0946
Especially the safety of railway passes is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout Germany .	-5.8974
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures , they must participate in the costs with one third , the rest share the railway and the federal government .	-6.1917
Schiltach ’ s mayor Roland Grie<unk>haber explained to the municipal council the characteristics of the railway transition " Am Hirschen " .	-4.5417
There the city plans to build a bunch of tunnels to the west of the railway tracks .	-6.4574
There may also be larger vehicles , such as those transporting long wood , in opposite traffic without having to block the track .	-5.6927
Greekeepers therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-10.2841
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council , as some councils doubted the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , brought the sentiment of critics to the point : ' Do we have to take so much money into the hands of so few vehicles ? '	-6.5935
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : the railway crossing " Hirschen " is regularly used for long wood transport .	-4.4451
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .	-5.9256
In addition , the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.7144
Bearing in mind that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and rebuilt , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway crossing " Am " Hirschen could also be important for a longer period of time .	-6.0094
The Councils agreed to have an investigation into the costs of the intended widening of the road .	-4.8160
Notwithstanding this , the majority agreed to the transformation of the railway transit , with the provision that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " to about 5.5 meters , if necessary for meeting traffic .	-7.8532
On the other hand , the transformation of the railway crossing at Gerbei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem concerning access to the rapidly rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-7.1058
The administration had investigated the rebuilding plans of the railway from the engineering office in Breinlinger , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was easily possible .	-6.9104
The investigation concluded that it was impossible to rule out the possibility that the propensity of the road could lead to longer vehicles being occupied .	-6.4924
The city , in turn , bears the responsibility for this as a road construction vehicle .	-5.8178
Consequently , the reconstruction could lead to liability disputes .	-4.4300
Haas argued that , since both the logging and the turning off worked in the current state of expansion , it should not be agreed to rebuild the railway transition .	-7.7187
The risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is also considerably lower at this point than at the other railway crossings , because the Mitte stop is right next to which there is a good visibility connection . .	-7.9944
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be braked to the point that no collision threatens .	-5.6082
The majority of the railway transition was refused consent , as the city of Schiltach would have to " swim out " the problem with reception vehicles , according to the councils , as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction works have been completed .	-9.3657
The panel considers it unproblematic the conversions at the railway passes " Before Heubach " and " Ber Kuhbach " , for which intersection agreements have already been made by rail .	-7.2985
Esa decides on large space missions : missions for billions of dollars	-2.5945
Far planets , gravitational waves or black holes - European Space Agency experts now need to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the coming years .	-3.4654
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-3.4609
Far worlds .	-0.7287
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.1570
No one knows whether there is life on at least some of them .	-3.1218
The choice is difficult : should you search for gravitational waves ?	-3.4680
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-2.4634
Or fleeing for earth-like planets and thus perhaps discovering alien life ?	-4.5286
These questions are being asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa .	-4.2911
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research .	-5.0969
The budget for such ' L missions ' is approximately EUR 1 billion each .	-2.8441
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.9068
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.0050
30 ideas were debated , five of which have now come into the closer election .	-4.8608
Numerous bodies examined the proposals and followed the researchers .	-4.5717
In the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee .	-3.0671
In total , the Esa has chosen four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme , initiated in 2007 , should be answered .	-5.5096
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?	-1.9512
The exact events in the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the emergence of planets surrounding these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-5.2055
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .	-2.0909
And if a star owns a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?	-3.4977
In 2017 , the " Cheops " space telescope will be launched to investigate more closely the 500 already known planet systems in our neighbourhood .	-5.7518
But the possibilities are limited , Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.6037
With larger instruments , astronomers could depict earth-like planets , even analyzing the composition of their atmospheres , seeking " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indication of biological activity .	-4.2266
How does the solar system work ?	-1.1741
This question , too , is ultimately to provide information on the conditions for the emergence of life .	-5.5457
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation from it with the planet system .	-4.2004
In our solar system , these processes can be examined in an example .	-11.1569
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already approved a M-class mission ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.5522
The probe will start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun closely .	-3.5077
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to researchers .	-7.4996
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in developing the solar system .	-3.1201
The Esa provides for the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme .	-3.6205
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to start its journey in 2022 .	-2.3852
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and was supposed to investigate the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-4.5975
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.8948
Worldwide , there are many ways to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature that we know are still valid there .	-5.9607
Perhaps there are deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .	-5.0697
How did the universe emerge and what is it ?	-3.1666
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos emerged from the big bang .	-3.3040
In addition to the matter we are familiar with , stars , planets and living beings like us , there are dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together , and dark energy , which accelerates the expansion of space .	-5.9531
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the Big Bang , nor what Dark Matter and Dark Energy consist of .	-4.7240
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved an M mission , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .	-4.1877
With a special telescope , the probe will examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-4.7381
Who could make the race	-2.3176
Of the 30 proposals , only two will be left at the end of the selection procedure .	-9.5461
In the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , the best chances for gravitational waves are to be approved as an L mission .	-6.2154
These include physicists ’ changes in the structure of space time , which Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-3.8578
They have not been proven to date .	-2.9428
Elisa could do that , hoping the scientists behind the project .	-3.0387
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in space .	-2.9692
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also prove gravitational waves created by the Big Bang , thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos .	-5.6978
Four other proposals still compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is to explore , among other things , black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is to track and investigate earth-like planets .	-5.6646
Proposals for sample return transport from Mars , for exploration of moon , Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics are already outstanding .	-5.6288
Snowden is ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance	-2.3650
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , declared that he was willing to travel to Berlin and announce before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities .	-4.5850
The German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-14.6329
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele , he writes : “ Although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a differing opinion as a violation of loyalty and tries to criminalise political expression with a penal threat , where no defence is possible . ”	-6.4374
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.9095
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him .	-4.2501
The charges made by the US Department of Justice include spying and theft of state property .	-4.0148
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . ”	-4.1518
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by claims that the NSA has intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.1726
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that one should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , “ without jeopardising him and completely ruining relations with the US . ”	-5.0171
Ströbele , a Green MEP , published a picture of himself and snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.3176
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.7180
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden cannot return to Russia when he leaves the country .	-3.6291
If Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the honourable Member said .	-4.1017
In his letter , Snowden declares that he is exposed to a “ serious and ongoing ” prosecution campaign that has driven him out of his homeland .	-11.2727
But he is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.9318
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public . .	-4.2587
In his letter , Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-3.5878
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage .	-2.5914
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers who wish to stow hand baggage on their flight .	-3.5876
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even though the announcement on Wednesday indicated that passengers should keep the entire can .	-4.0992
The new charge applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-9.4591
Frontier explained that you will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who paid at the boarding pass .	-7.4835
Frontier spokesman Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is aimed at moving travellers to take care of the payment in advance .	-3.6023
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.7827
Airlines began to charge the first and second item of checked baggage in 2008 .	-2.6599
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stopped in their hand baggage as much as possible , which means that the baggage fans are often overfilled above the seat .	-6.1251
Fees are one way to encourage passengers to take less on board .	-3.2762
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .	-2.0748
It is about the most loyal Frontier customers , who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat .	-5.7042
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .	-2.5841
This means that a passenger may take one piece of baggage free of charge at the Frontier Airport , but the next person will have to pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .	-5.1021
O 'Malley declared that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive at the boarding pass .	-4.8734
The new Frontier hand baggage fee will only come into force in the summer , and there is no exact date yet .	-4.8029
Passengers often have baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines like to use them .	-5.0349
They argue that transporting baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-3.6491
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-4.1552
Most of them have , however , left the fingers of hand baggage fees .	-5.0556
Spirit Airlines Inc . , three years ago , required first hand baggage fees and later , Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-5.0350
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , the airline advisor Jay Sorensen , who closely monitors the additional charges .	-3.7052
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit ’ s hand baggage fee was $ 50 million a year .	-3.6687
Sorensen , who formerly held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected at the gate if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee .	-6.0322
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my aviation career , ” he said .	-3.4884
I expected to see teeth crazy and handy discussions at the pavement .	-4.7949
“ The aircraft was full , ” he said , “ and the boarding ran like lubricated . ”	-2.6709
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-3.0006
The company declared that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the entire can and that coffee should be filled free of charge .	-4.7885
Water is still free .	-1.3670
US Airways tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008 , but reversed it seven months later after passengers had complained and no other large company had followed .	-4.7362
Frontier ’ s move to charge hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-4.3156
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 per ticket sold .	-2.4676
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency .	-4.7504
Frontier , however , has gone the widest in this area .	-3.3637
In September , the company began to award only half the number of frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-4.2029
On Wednesday , miles were reduced to 25 % of the route .	-2.8894
For this reason , a flight booked by a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles will only bring customers 250 miles .	-5.7648
Passengers can also reserve only when purchasing directly on the Frontier Platz website .	-3.7671
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but business is shrinking and the company is losing money .	-3.2888
The revenue decreased by 9 percent , and the flight capacity shrunk almost 13 percent in the first quarter , as can be seen in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-5.4782
Republic has tried to control Frontier 's finances as part of the sale of society .	-10.4826
Proverbs come from the Bible	-2.0845
Almost 40 women visited the last women ’ s breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .	-4.3213
The theme of the day in the Municipal House was " proverbs from the Bible " and " Middle Ages speeches " .	-4.4246
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the parish council , entered the biblical proverbs after breakfast .	-5.4433
" Proverbs contain lifestyles , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-3.5301
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible places and explained the meaning .	-3.0413
She called proverbs like : wooden eye be vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone who gives His there the Lord in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-4.4215
On several occasions , the speaker also advised their listeners what proverb they were .	-4.7290
The Middle Ages speech was adopted by Christel Dehner : all good things are three , blue , slightly haunted .	-6.8039
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-3.2159
Finally , a raffle was raffled .	-3.3565
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners .	-3.8214
Among the visitors of the breakfast round there was also a mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger .	-4.0207
Learning instead of unemployed : Pilot project for Unskilled Tourism	-3.3669
A pilot project for the tourism industry started at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte .	-3.1768
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified over three winters to specialists in hotels and restaurants .	-5.4220
" New to this is the end of the six-month courses , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency .	-4.3255
The benefits are varied : participants would not be unemployed , firms would receive skilled workers who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-4.9079
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotels and Restaurants Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-3.2923
NSA declares that an “ internal error ” and not a hacker are to blame for the crash of the website ’ s crash .	-3.7876
The shadow National Security Agency declared on late Friday that an error had paralysed its public website a few hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-4.6753
“ NSA.gov was unattainable for a few hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explained the Spionagentur in a message sent by email .	-5.1931
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-2.0192
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.6202
In the early evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unreachable for at least six hours and that this is still not available to some users .	-4.5345
Previously , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.2135
Secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .	-2.6076
At least a group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.4462
Such attacks flood the target website with page views until the server is overloaded and the website collapses .	-4.2601
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system .	-2.8228
The previously super-secret NSA , whose nickname was No Search Agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public , and is facing sharp criticism following the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-6.8993
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyber operation .	-3.1843
The number of people without jobs declined slightly in October by 22 to 1,307 .	-2.9118
Although the ratio is 3.1 % better than last year and also better than in September , " we would have hoped for more , " says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Managing Director of the Work Agency in Sonthofen .	-12.6877
Many companies have so far reacted to recruitment .	-4.0619
One reason for this is , according to Felder-Bauer : " We have hardly any skilled workers in crafts , health care and care for the elderly " .	-5.3073
As a result of the season , job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant sector have been opened again since September .	-7.3731
In the middle of December the winter season starts .	-2.9838
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt from 31.10.2013 ( page 33 ) .	-4.0979
Bombardier ’ s profit loss after decline in delivery numbers and orders	-4.2028
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in net profit on Thursday after he had come under pressure from declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter as well as contractual problems in the railway sector .	-5.4278
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also failed to publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September .	-5.7260
The test aircraft ’ s maiden flight a month and a half ago only three more launches have been followed , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is as planned .	-7.1723
The results stayed behind the forecasts and led to a fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-4.1153
Cameron Doerksen , National Bank Financial Analyst , lowered his “ outperform ” rating to “ sector performance ” on Thursday with a limited share potential in the next one to two quarters .	-5.0060
“ Although weaker aircraft delivery numbers were largely expected , we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-5.2794
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the testing program for the aircraft advances .	-3.6101
However , if no new orders are made available in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-4.2090
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft range can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.5202
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays .	-2.6527
But , so far , binding orders for the CSeries are moderate with 177 , as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new nozzle aircraft are true .	-5.0469
Currently , there are 403 orders and promises from 15 customers and companies .	-11.0747
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet .	-3.4172
On Thursday , the management also assured analysts and media that the program was in the schedule .	-4.1940
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference , adding that ground testing and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft ’ s lifetime .	-5.1637
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.5140
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period , which we have done .	-4.6042
This is done throughout the flight programme .	-9.3769
The second of five test aircraft will probably start in the next few weeks , the rest shortly thereafter , it was called from the company side .	-4.8157
However , analysts remain sceptical about whether the first customer can commission an aircraft from the CSeries twelve months after the maiden flight .	-4.9366
Bombardier explained that it will review the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-4.2032
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if it appears to be equivalent to Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-4.1201
In the third quarter with the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share a year before .	-3.9388
The adjusted profit per share remains 9 cents .	-2.6338
Sales declined slightly from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.6119
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S .	-3.0791
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that he has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-3.2029
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.5784
On September 30 , the order book in the aerospace sector amounted to $ 32.9 billion , unchanged compared to December 31 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-15.4635
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were within the framework of our guidelines , but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.3244
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.4197
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector increased by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.1030
On September 30 , the order book in the transport division was $ 32.6 billion , slightly increased compared to December 31 .	-16.3981
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-3.8723
According to corporate governance , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .	-8.2734
In the afternoon trading on Thursday , the Bombardier share dropped by 8.5 % and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , after announcing that Google ’ s Executive Board will change Patrick Pichette to the Bo.	-5.4893
Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier ’ s closest rival , reported a 10 % decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday .	-3.1910
USA Shots at Los Angeles Airport	-1.7840
An unknown man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning ( local time ) .	-3.3308
Whereas the airport management informed Twitter that the shooter was in custody , the " Los Angeles Times " reported that the man was dead .	-5.1390
A security man has also been killed .	-1.5193
The media also reported several injured .	-1.8425
US President Barack Obama will be kept constantly informed of the situation , said the White House spokesman , Jay Carney .	-2.8927
The incident occurred in Terminal 3 . Eyewitnesses said they had seen a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls , as several media reported .	-3.6147

The incident began at 9.30 a.m. ( local time ) , as the airport management informed about Twitter .	-4.1178
The access roads were blocked , which , according to CNN , resulted in long restructuring .	-5.4817
Apart from landings , air traffic had been temporarily suspended .	-12.0204
However , several aircraft were also observed on CNN at startup .	-4.3767
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines .	-2.1872
Los Angeles LAX Airport is a major airport in the United States .	-3.4098
Cocaine dependent lawyer , who warned drug boss against police investigation , must be in prison .	-4.2187
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information to the underworld size Neil Scarborough further .	-3.5936
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light .	-2.1793
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-1.9844
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison .	-12.1763
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-3.7608
He was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police supervised Scarborough , whom he had represented in an earlier drug trial , by the “ first-class ” lawyer , with the nickname “ Bash . ”	-6.9064
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a meal of the bar .	-5.0210
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-4.1059
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-3.1345
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-2.6321
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds in a number of household searches and $ 200,000 in cash .	-5.2222
Ditta , 42 , passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public .	-3.5143
Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted of the Liverpool Crown Court in two charges of disability of the judiciary following a triple week trial .	-5.0168
He granted cocaine ownership in an earlier survey .	-2.9729
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.5114
Two investigative officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house , where drugs with a purity of 60 % were placed under the lawyer ’ s garbage tonne in a black golf glove .	-5.2306
Shortly after delivering the drugs , Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta , who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-17.3466
The lawyer returned home , fetched the drugs , and then nine messages were exchanged between the two .	-2.8932
In court it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after testing class A drugs had been discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-4.0323
Ditta was later arrested , but disputed taking cocaine and said he talked to the alleged dealer because he was his client , claiming that their discussion was subject to the “ lawyer secret . ”	-5.0516
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him .	-3.1917
In police interrogation , he stated that he operated an office and clients would call him at home for legal matters , both under his private address and at work .	-12.9181
It was announced in court that he had called important drug traffickers , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them .	-5.0094
Public prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that the law is not breaked . ”	-9.9002
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , because he was too much involved with certain clients .	-5.0744
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-3.1219
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-2.9616
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.5405
He opposed police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-11.6715
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute .	-2.9528
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.2624
Ditta pointed out every misconduct and claimed : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but would do so immediately . ”	-5.2744
But after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began to buy drugs from organized criminals . ”	-4.1694
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-4.3716
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence .	-2.4872
Ditta underwent this confidence and tried to hide behind the fa<unk>ade of his profession .	-3.4967
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire conducted the investigations against Ditta , which also resulted in three condemnations of the possession of cocaine and disability of justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.7554
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that nobody can escape the arm of the law .	-2.9225
We will find you and bring you to court .	-1.4786
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy to trade in heroin , cocaine and cannabis .	-3.4053
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking — people were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .	-3.8314
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , stating that his dream job is to represent lawyers in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and equal opportunities is the motivation for his work .	-5.5689
Revolutionary work of church music	-1.2792
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary , the song rank Dunningen will frame two services of worship with the " German Trade Fair " by Franz Schubert .	-10.3132
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which inspired the spectators in the spring of this year , the song crane at the end of the anniversary year will enrich two services of worship with the performance of the Deutsche Messe von Franz Schubert .	-5.1950
On Saturday 26 October , this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19 during the evening fair in the St. Martinus Church of Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October at 10.15 a.m. at the service of the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf .	-5.6872
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Gesänge zur Feier des Holy Victims der Messe " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation .	-6.1826
The exhibition is performed as part of the services of worship , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.4691
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsin Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .	-3.0825
Haslach : Skepticism is increasingly giving way to confidence .	-3.1414
The 2015 Parish Council elections will change fundamentally , for example , in the Haslach ( SE ) Seel.	-4.9959
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-3.4221
At a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschenstein prepared for the changes .	-3.1955
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese have nothing to change and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.4329
In the course of the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism of the new is hesitant but increasingly deviating from confidence .	-6.8272
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions between the six bodies with the chairman of the Seelsorgeteam reached .	-5.4738
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the newly formed guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg . . in in in in . in in . in . in in .	-12.2394
In the future , SE Haslach , as a parish , will form a body of public law that enters the rights and obligations of the six church communities so far .	-6.5617
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the parish power is represented .	-4.0019
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish ; in the six parish groups , so-called community teams are form.	-5.0690
Their task will be to promote the ecclesiastical life of the village in the future .	-4.8910
When it comes to the finances of the individual parish community , there was considerable need for discussion .	-4.8931
The innovations stipulate that accumulated credits in the parishes will be kept for purpose .	-6.1905
By contrast , liabilities are transferred to the community as a whole .	-3.9108
It was precisely with regard to the large planned investments , whose obligation then all the parish parties make , that there was great concern .	-7.2981
" Even in the past , it was only invested in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone , " relativized Haslach 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-5.9128
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes described Barbar Knights , the chairman of the panel in the Schutterwald-Neuried Seelsorgeunit .	-4.3997
In 2006 , they set themselves the task of ' becoming one , staying five ' and found that this is not so easy at all .	-11.7306
The bodies of the Haslach Seelsorgeunit then asked themselves to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-5.3651
The drafts will be made concrete at further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-11.6304
In the end , parish council Michael Schöner of Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelsorgeunit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-12.7471
In Pullendorf , electricity becomes more expensive .	-2.8949
The citizens of Ppullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-3.5117
As the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-person Pfullendorf family will cost 70 to 90 euros per year .	-5.5652
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-2.7779
This levy is redefined each year in October by the four operators of the large electricity roads .	-4.7916
These quantify the additional costs incurred by the energy turnaround , which they can levy above the price of electricity .	-6.4160
The city works of Ppullendorf form the last link in this chain .	-3.3380
In its forecasts , the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even assumed a higher levy , as Jörg-Arne Bias reported .	-3.4207
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-4.2377
" We assume an increase of 1 cent plus x " , says Bias , with the number more close to 2 cents .	-4.5207
Lasting traffic light : watch out for waiting time .	-4.8068
Sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .	-2.9538
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-2.5050
What should you do - ride with red ?	-4.6465
If a person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-4.5954
However , the waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently from one case to another .	-4.7487
Becker advises you to stay at least five minutes before the traffic light is disrupted .	-4.3904
However , anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it .	-5.7999
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough , Becker warns and refers to a decision by the Hamm Oberlandesgericht .	-4.2775
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes and had to be responsible for negligent red light offences .	-5.3822
After all , the traffic light was not broken , but rather diverted to the green shortly afterwards .	-5.4869
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine .	-5.3341
The municipal council is delighted with a solid budget .	-4.4020
Whenever local council meetings are concerned with the budget , mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-3.3666
The municipal baggage in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not known the administration since 2005 .	-3.3252
The financial year 2012 can also be seen as a full success in this sense .	-4.3382
This became clear in the presentation of the 2012 accounts .	-3.2448
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget , at around EUR 7.6 million , has exceeded EUR 1 million .	-4.5184
The surplus of the administrative budget , with around EUR 1.8 million , also amounts to around EUR 1 million above the approach .	-5.1065
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the community share in income tax .	-4.9988
The asset budget , too , was significantly higher than planned values .	-4.3580
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.3395
" This is essentially due to the increase in the administrative budget " , says Rothmund .	-4.7632
With less investment than planned in the 2012 financial year , reserve intake has also been higher .	-4.4495
Overall , the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now .	-3.3260
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-2.0125
" You don 't just shake such a work out of the sleeve , " Gerster praised the annual accounts .	-4.8637
He and the municipal councils visibly welcomed the good figures .	-3.4844
It may sound paradoxical , but these very good figures could soon be expensive for citizens .	-3.8332
In the past , the municipality was able to renounce high lifts due to its good financial position .	-6.3650
In turn , however , according to Gerster , subsidies have already been cut by the country on a number of occasions .	-5.4700
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory sticks .	-3.5748
Among other things , cities and communities that apply for grants must have certain lifting rates .	-4.1047
" We have to look at the issue of lifting stocks , as investments are to be made in the coming years , for which we would like to receive subsidies , " Gerster announced in this context .	-6.6809
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in the Choir for 60 years now .	-7.8827
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the Cäcilia Men ’ s Association is almost twice as long as the autumn festival in which he was celebrated .	-5.5525
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing association .	-3.7648
After 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir , which is now probably more than favourable .	-7.4616
In the association , Wermter was also active , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .	-3.7716
He received several awards for his commitment and club scattering : Jörg Kohr , a pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , gave him a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince .	-5.9153
His singer colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German Choir Association and a engraved pewter .	-4.9740
In addition to the honour , the 31st Autumn Festival took place in familiar railways : with the MGV Betra , the song crane Salzstetten , the singer department Baisingen and the local music association , the Vollmaringers had loaded a colourful mixture of choirs and vocal styles , which maintained the approximately 400 visitors .	-6.9597
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with songs like " In Wine Paradise " and " Lustig , her brother " .	-4.1112
Her honorary singer , Hubert Wermter , was honoured by a small band - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-5.6644
The Men ’ s Choir Association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as Julius Wengert ’ s “ Hunter Wengert ” , “ Weit , Weit , Far Weg ” from Hubert Goisern and the folk song “ When you go through the valley ” .	-6.2654
The Liederkranz Salzstetten , with his mixed choir and his group of women - the " Impulschor " - ensured the festival 's women 's quota .	-13.4111
The mixed choir , with the Neapolitan folk " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " of Antos Gus , kidnapped to foreign countries , while the " Impulchor " also used foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " belonged to their program .	-5.3369
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with " What the Schwob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts " Bierlied " , where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion .	-6.2440
For the kids there was a small side program - " Grandma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the kids used to do well for lunch .	-6.1928

Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the savings bank Zollernalb .	-3.0303
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will be processed directly by the helpers .	-3.0963
Helpers can be parents , grandparents , friends , clubs and , of course , the educators and children themselves .	-3.3382
Kenyan press outrages controversial media law	-1.7161
“ We are in a frightening situation and one can ask ourselves : what does Parliament stop simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional .	-6.5408
“ The law is draconian and punishable and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , CEO of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news sites .	-3.4015
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-3.3609
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and to send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-10.8327
According to the newspaper The Star , the government , through the new law , “ effectively takes the media in a stranglehold , ” whereas The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Speech in Kenya would have suffered “ a serious blow , ” and called the draft “ draconian . ”	-6.2052
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September .	-3.6430
The Kenyan media went on to rage the authorities because they published photos of security cameras showing how the units sent to the factory allegedly robbed out the luxurious shopping centre .	-20.5980
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to this by appointing two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate , even if the subpoena was withdrawn after an outcry .	-3.9308
According to the new law , media houses can be punished with up to 20 million Kenyan schillingen , and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-4.7221
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the ownership of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-5.2594
According to the Daily Nation , “ one punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-2.5278
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on Kenya ’ s description of “ lively blogosphere . ”	-3.2706
If they silence the media , politicians could do whatever they want with impunity .	-2.8777
“ No one will ever experience it , ” Mutuma Mathiu wrote , a journalist at the nation that describes Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life .	-4.5570
“ Leave politicians to themselves , lead the country into bankruptcy and return to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-3.4986
Kenya ’ s legislators have already suffered public anger in the past .	-4.4253
In May , they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the national remuneration commission , and reinstated their fragile salaries of around 532,000 schilling tax free per month – one of the highest in the world .	-6.3582
Bad-Dürrheim : A dream becomes true for the FC .	-1.9182
The official inauguration ceremony for the Art Grass Sports Square , despite the cold weather and the rain , did not lose any importance for the city and the football club .	-5.7697
Everyone wanted a more pleasant holiday last Saturday , but Peter did not want to play with it .	-13.4371
Thus , all those who came without a umbrella or could not keep one for some reason .	-5.2256
This went to the musicians who framed the festival , as did many speakers .	-4.7827
Wess was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .	-4.0723
His thanks were mainly due to Mayor Walter Klumpp , who has been very committed to the implementation of the project , the municipal council , the companies involved and members of the association involved .	-6.4422
Here , especially Lothar Hero , Paul Weizenegger , Heiner Gail and Peter Graf .	-2.6278
The rugged pensioners moved 400 square meters of pavement stones for the new paths .	-3.1618
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the Landtag Member , Karl Rombach .	-4.0126
Further greetings were given to the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the Southern Badian football association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office , who announced a donation to the club ’ s youth department .	-5.0836
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn square in such a way that it could not be played .	-4.7784
Fifteen years ago , the first considerations were given to solving the problem when the construction of a third place was planned at the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee .	-5.8846
Both have been rejected .	-1.5591
Six years ago , thoughts came up on the creation of an artificial grass sport site , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .	-5.6488
Specific plans were launched two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht , pledged a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site , and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000 .	-4.5381
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000 , summarised Klumpp .	-4.1223
The construction of the artificial grass square of 68 metres was started on 4 June .	-5.6057
During the construction phase lasting over three months , 3000 cubic metres of earth were removed , half of which was used to lay a dirt bike track .	-5.3656
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial matters .	-2.8794
The relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning .	-3.2791
Among other things , it is about direct democracy , bribery of Members and the Federal Police .	-4.2153
In the morning , the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its deliberations .	-2.7888
This should include the issue of double citizenship , where both sides have contradictory ideas .	-4.6764
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double pass .	-3.8182
On the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda this Friday , the SPD reinforced its ' no ' to a car toll demanded by the CSU .	-3.9599
A vignette is a ' flatrate for many and thus environmentally counterproductive ' , explained the SPD negotiator on transport , Florian Pronold , in a letter to his group .	-4.5218
There were threats of evasive traffic on land roads , which are already priorities for accidents .	-6.0558
Moreover , the introduction of a toll for all cars would , from Pronolds ’ point of view , only be a first step .	-4.5866
" There is a danger that German compensation will be deleted at a later date , " he said .	-3.2498

Vienna Airport creates passenger calls	-2.4211
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.0229
In the future there will be no longer any such announcement at Vienna Schwechat Airport .	-5.7965
A large part of the speaker passes away - the noise level is to be reduced so clearly .	-6.0299
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere .	-2.5609
As Airport spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the recruitment of passes affecting individuals .	-5.0182
For example , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already waiving noisy calls .	-3.6000
By abolishing these messages - on average , about 200 personal calls by the speakers sound on a day - in the future it will be more calm at the airport .	-8.7294
" Experience has also shown that these individual passengers have been perceived relatively little , but at the same time all the other information on modified flights or departure times is falling a bit , " says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-7.7698

The newly designed opponent shines with a new cafe .	-4.3004
One that invites you to stay and come back .	-2.6525
One that wants to make the name of the program .	-2.5684
According to the lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation once .	-10.9594
In the case of visiting the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight of the University of Rhine-Waal , it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-11.7943
After all , the café , with its beautiful name , aims precisely that : to make a real stay not only memorable , but also to make it possible to experience it again and again .	-8.2344
Because it 's fun and simply beautiful .	-2.9686
A glimpse into the inner life of Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first sigh. . . . . . . . . . . .	-11.6538
The state-of-the-art but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good .	-4.2027
The team of founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoil the guest with a variety of coffee and cocktail varieties .	-4.3297
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-11.7115
The owners , both 33 years old , already made a name for themselves as gastronomers before the opening of the pretty café at the Opschlag : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-5.6080
From the move to Kleve to the opponent , the pleasant café lovers hope more audience .	-5.7325
Not least through the university .	-2.6866
Daniel Büttner emphasizes that we do not have a specific target group .	-4.7396
Rather , the two young students here want to address the same thing as seniors and all age groups in between .	-5.0396
Speaking of café lovers .	-1.7675
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment .	-4.0153
Enjoy the fragrant hot beverage in a variety of variations .	-4.7722
Expressofan	-1.1865
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker .	-2.4370
" A baguette - that 's my thing , " she tells the NRC .	-4.2230
Two events were also held in the bright café .	-4.2123
Better to say one thing .	-1.7433
After all , the port festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.0747
But there was also the nightmare night .	-3.2330
" Beautiful , successful and funny " , found the two 33-year-old .	-2.9820
But it is not everyone 's business .	-7.2968
Perhaps that is why Daniel Büttner is not an outstanding fan of event evenings : " You cannot do it all right " .	-5.4412
And with an event I always address only those who are interested in the special event .	-3.9549
This is why events will be the exception for us .	-4.0147
" We want to disrupt normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.5646
In other words , Déjà Vu stands for reliability .	-3.0184
With regard to the quality of the products offered here , as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the opponent in Kleve . , .	-5.0530

UN announces new targets for poverty reduction	-2.7032
The United Nations is now starting to set out a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .	-4.3361
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals expiring in 2015 .	-3.1859
They have been included in the final draft document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.8919
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-2.8227
“ I am pleased that the member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.7009
“ These objectives will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .	-2.7351
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate granted to me by the Member States to realise our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.9225
Even if the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the Handball Oberligisten continues to feel good .	-13.4829
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this .	-3.0127
Everyone continues to be fully motivated .	-2.7166
Nevertheless , I hope we will finally win again .	-10.7037
" I don 't even know how to taste such a victory " , Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-4.5566
Even if the third liga reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out trees , Malmon warns the index finger in advance .	-5.5441
I have trained many players myself in the A-Youth . . . . . , , , , , . , , , ,	-9.4548
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-3.7915
" In addition , we have to wait to see if there is still amplification from the first one , " says the SG coach .	-6.4431
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison with previous performances .	-4.6495
Especially in the coverage and switching game , it was a big mistake .	-8.1516
Employment of opportunities must definitely improve .	-3.6954
So I hope that my players will finally get their heads free during the short break .	-4.4417
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures .	-2.2703
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and the first President of Mozambique to vote for peace calls in a rare public demonstration .	-3.7710
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.1338
For fear of the country ’ s future , she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the label “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital ’ s independence square .	-5.8903
For two weeks , there have been reports almost every day of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .	-13.8149
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-3.7081
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-2.1835
Analysts find it unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-blown conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.4429
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from firms like Rio Tinto , Vale of Brazil , Eni of Italy , and Anadarko from the US into the next few years .	-11.0843
The ruling Frelimo party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo blame each other for the tensions .	-2.7066
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province , a traditional Renamos stronghold , on 17 October .	-3.6135
The attacks on previous rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group leader , Renamo ’ s spokesman to the Financial Times .	-3.2997
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-1.9227
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability .	-2.0520
Towards AFP , the French news agency , on Wednesday , he said that Dhlakama considered himself a “ loser , ” who wants to “ use all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-11.1020
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-2.3335
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words of Renamo giving up the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.5366
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement .	-4.5538
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations and to do so seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-2.9713
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.3484
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who collapse the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert .	-3.6215
None of them is well negotiated and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.8109
Renamo , pushing for electoral reform , has already said that she will boycott the November local elections .	-3.0357
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-8.1062
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-3.6491
Renamo ’ s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in the elections .	-3.7762
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.8909
“ He doesn ’ t want multi-party democracy , he doesn ’ t want transparent elections , he doesn ’ t want peace because he doesn ’ t want to give up the presid, ” Mazanga .	-3.3257
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has undertaken disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on important North-South connections .	-3.7881
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-4.8128
In June , Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-3.1433
Mazanga was reluctant to answer the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat .	-3.6907
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.2746
Fernando Lima , Head of Mediacoop , says that instability has increased the frustration of the government , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent wave of abductions .	-5.3603
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.2931
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.5563
“ No one interested Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-4.0802
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models for life , ” an author says .	-4.2924
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-2.8388
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught to schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland argued for a “ careful selection ” of age-oriented works .	-4.6452
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.4211
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years .	-1.9967
He added that among authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ disable ” completely , because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ subliminal . ”	-4.7614
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as far as possible . ”	-4.3967
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope .	-2.7341
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.4590
This must be understated , revealed by history and not explained .	-3.8589
This is the old story of showing instead of telling .	-3.3741
Hansjakob is returning to Freihof	-9.8245
100 years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob moved to Haslach , where his last years were living in the " Freihof " on Sunday .	-4.3792
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the very short scene game .	-9.8525
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death , script writer and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece , which received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk .	-4.9947
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesperson with the ten different scenes , explained contexts and bridged periods from youth to nearby retirement .	-3.5291
On October 22 , 1913 , Hansjakob comes home to his children ’ s sky , in his Freihof .	-4.4648
And then the scene game began , in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his paraderolle as a great son of the city .	-4.1030
He performed in style with the Zweispunner and " Black Forest foxes " by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach .	-4.8458
He was not only received with a lot of applause from the audience , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-3.9056
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to engage in the role of the sister and gave her immense lives in mimics and gestures .	-4.6444
The Mühlenbach Bauernkapelle played selected music pieces between the individual scenes and completed the performance .	-5.6716
Haslach ’ s mayor Heinz Winkler gave the honour to award honorary citizenship , who , in representation of the then incumbent , made Hättich his presence together with a part of the city council .	-13.2621
Their expectations then made the Three-King-Singers who led Hansjakob to the exclamation : " Oh like beautiful , there again youth memories of my own Three-Kingdom Age are alive " .	-7.8943
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud " Out , Out " .	-4.1554
His criticism of the Church at the time was just as expressed by Hansjakob as his concerns about agricultural excesses , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .	-5.4549
In the homeland , behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-5.2507
" A disturbing spirit had finally found its calm and had gone home forever , " said it at the end of the scene game .	-5.1614
A lot of applause and many commendable words were given by the audience for the performance .	-4.3993
Basketball : The hope of the Neckar Giants is growing .	-2.7152
The chances for the league remaining of the sportlessly descended Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketballers have increased .	-5.0221
Because if there is a wildcard procedure , there is now a competitor less for the Neckar giants .	-3.8334
The basketball project Hamburg Towers waives an application for a possible background .	-3.9134
" We will not participate in the Wildcard process , " said former national player Pascal Roller , who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic City since 2012 .	-4.5105
However , a first breathing was not heard from Ludwigsburg .	-4.2122
" We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it was established that Düsseldorf was not licensed , " said Neckar-Giesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-4.4998
Until 23 May , ascendants of Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove their federal economic capability .	-6.0233
So far , however , the Rhine countries have been denied the license twice .	-3.0298
The arbitration court is the last instance .	-1.9781
Haigerloch : Abendmahlskirche moves to the point of view .	-4.3560
As a contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch , the City Culture and Tourism Office dedicates the last of its public theme tours on Sunday 27 October , the evening meal church .	-5.0413

Snowden could also say something in Russia	-2.3774
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US affair in his Russian asylum .	-3.1120
Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor ’ s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia .	-4.1479
This was reported by the Interfax Agency , calling on unnamed circles familiar with the situation .	-4.2652
Such an issue could be resolved intergovernmentally , it was said .	-3.8680
Snowden is practically excluded from Russia .	-4.0280
" In this case he loses his refugee status , " the agency quoted its source .	-2.7060
Because Germany is an ally of the United States , Snowden is threatening extradition there , it continued to say that it was said to be an ally of the United States .	-7.1190
Long breath pays off	-1.9220

Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land .	-1.9330
They distribute the coal coming from the vessels to the stalls .	-4.3896
The company has several irons in the fire at its location .	-3.8930
In addition to coal imports , Rhenus Midgard relies , among other things , on wind plant loglogistics .	-3.8226
Black shimmers the coal on the storage site in front of the dike .	-4.0459
Two massive blue bulk and return chargers distribute or load the coal as needed .	-4.9991
Every movement of the handling devices sounds a steep warning noise over the terrain .	-5.7326
" The signals serve security and are legally prescribed , " says Matthias Schrell , Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .	-3.1399
In the event of unfavourable winds , this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city .	-6.0475

Despite its first defeat , Bavaria ’ s basketballer was optimistic in his basketballer ’ s mind .	-5.0965
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketballers of the FC Bavaria Munich .	-3.6538
" No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe over the past two years , " Bavarian coach Svetislav Pesic accounted for the unfortunate 83 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) on Thursday evening with title defender Olympiakos Piraeus .	-4.6112
We sent the message : Basketball also exists in Munich !	-2.1569
Munich sold very well for a long time at its third appearance in the European Königsklasse , but were simply not clear enough in the decisive stages .	-7.4286
The guests first created the piece of art to turn a 15-point lag 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus gave another turn to the game .	-5.8205
" We fought incredibly backwards against the two-time Euroleague Champion , but then made reckless mistakes again , " said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi . . . . . . . , , . , , , , ,	-11.2874

Ben Greenman : Ten Years New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker	-1.6598
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America : barely a hundred years ago , the varietal artist Frank Fay , who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway , began to tell the crowd jokes in the form of a conversation .	-4.4128
Over the years , Fays Innovation has been expanded , as last at the New York Comedy Festival .	-3.6674
Called and led by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the Carolines stand-up institution , the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres .	-3.8886
“ Most of these headliners began with Carolines and then became more successful until they were known to appear in a club at some point , ” said Hirsch .	-4.8218
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them .	-3.2637
At this year ’ s event there are performances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher , as well as by “ Stand Up for Heroes ” , an annual music and comedy event for Army Events at the Madison Square Garden , where Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby perform .	-4.6359
The world of comedy has grown with the festival .	-2.8864
A number of comedians attending the festival this year have become known for rather unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central , FX and Spike .	-4.5361
Nick Kroll became famous with a sitcom on cable TV ( the ironically slippery fantasy football series “ The League ” on FXX ) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central .	-3.5857
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation in both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation , although she is most famous for her viral video series “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes On ” .	-4.3989
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , the ironic W. Kaumau Bell , focused on racial issues ) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .	-3.3191
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview : David Steinberg speaks with Larry David .	-4.1241
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian .	-3.5098
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a TV show entitled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ” at TV Land .	-3.0498
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan .	-2.2815
“ The city is definitely in Larry ’ s comedy DNA , ” said Steinberg .	-2.2677
He told me when he is here , then he sometimes walks through the street between two buildings and thinks : Hey , if I lose all my money , then perhaps I live here .	-4.2091

Drama in Uruguay : Young kill playmates with Machete	-2.7218
Two children admitted in Uruguay the murder of a 11-year-old .	-2.0015
The two 14 and 12 year-old boys had invited their victims to go hunting with them .	-3.3227
Armed with machetes and knives , they arrive at the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well , reported the newspaper " El País " on Thursday .	-4.2263
Then they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district . .	-3.6549
The corpse was found in the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado , 15 km north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este .	-3.6035
As an alibi , a five-year-old half sister of the younger woman who had taken her with her should say that she was sexually attacked by the boy .	-5.0792
But when the girl described the action before the police without mentioning an attack on them , the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .	-4.4248
Among other things , the elderly called it a rivalry in football .	-4.3493
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth organization .	-3.2163

Due to exploitative trafficking in human beings , stockpiling , threat , insult and dangerous bodily injury , the Regional Court of Konstanz has condemned a 33-year-old St. Georgen man to three and a half years in prison .	-5.6242
The former Bundeswehr soldier , who worked as a doorstep after two missions in Afghanistan , issued a confession under a trial agreement .	-4.6420
Accordingly , in five cases , he met women via Internet or telephone contacts , which he sent to the line after a few weeks against their will .	-6.0935
He used resistance to break with violence and threats .	-2.9747
He retained the revenue of women who , for some years , acquired for him .	-4.4991
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards , he stopped contacts between women to the outside world .	-8.1932
Together with a colleague who conveyed women , he brought them to various brothels in the southwest .	-3.9407
He had them partly monitored to control their revenue .	-4.6382
In court , the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died alongside him in an explosion .	-5.0888
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about mental constraints and thus about reduced guilt , the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession .	-6.6046
The court did not have to hear any of the damaged women .	-3.4764
As a Kripo official reported , at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings could be identified after a first display by telephone surveillance measures . . . . . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.8506
The intercepted talks had been characterised by high aggression .	-2.9093
In subsequent interrogations , the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom .	-7.1160
Another witness in which one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body has not yet made any statement .	-4.4980
It is a " totally broken personality " who regard violence and exploitation as normal in this field .	-4.6456
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday .	-8.8748
" He solved himself out of these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after detention , " he said .	-4.9966
Oil prices continue to drop to USD 96 per barrel .	-2.4357
The price of oil has fallen further on Friday , after worries about a high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing . .	-4.6291
The reference crude oil for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange to USD 96.24 per barrel in Europe late morning .	-4.1076
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday , implying a 5.8 percent decline in October .	-3.4195
The large crude oil supply has burdened prices in recent weeks .	-3.9378
On Wednesday , the US Department of Energy declared that the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .	-2.5614
Over the course of five weeks , supply had increased by 25 million barrels . . . . . , , , , , . , , , ,	-10.9309
But on Friday , there were indications of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in Chinese manufacturing activity .	-4.4125
This suggests a continued recovery in China ’ s economy , whose growth had risen to 7.8 % in the third quarter , following the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades .	-4.5547
Crude oil from Brent , a reference value for international crude oil , also used by US refineries , fell by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London .	-3.6359
Court of Justice blocks Decision on the Stop and Fresh Directive of the NYPD	-3.4892
On Thursday , a federal appeal court in the United States blocked the arrangement of a judge who had called for changes to the stop-and-fresh program ( “ Stop and browse ” ) of the New York police department , and dismissed the judge from the case .	-12.9639
The 2nd U.S. appeal court declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until the city was appointed .	-4.6112
The judge judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and consulting people was implemented .	-4.3976
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered , including the decision to set up a supervisory body to assist the police in amending their directive and training programme .	-5.0107
On Tuesday , the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension that was required .	-9.2802
The appeal report declared that the judge must be disconnected from the case because it violated the Code of Conduct for US Judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which it had responded publicly to the Court 's criticism .	-5.9653
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they unduly targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-fresh programme .	-3.3109
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in guidelines , training and service , and ordered a pilot program with cameras on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out .	-5.7381
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were redundant after police control .	-3.9375
An oral negotiation to appoint the city is scheduled after March 14 , 2014 .	-8.3940
The stop-and-fresh tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates .	-9.2357
Such controls have been in various forms for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-4.2850
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities filed complaints that evolved into a collective action .	-5.1427
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop-and-fresh program say that changes will end unfair practices , create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way other police presidencies use the scheme .	-4.5671
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police , but not crime ; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force under pressure after the abolition of thousands of posts in the last decade .	-5.5624
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-fresh practice , which is constitutional , but only reform the way in which NYPD controls were implemented .	-4.7351

With this Bedouin wisdom , the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association " Helping Hands " .	-3.1607
On Saturday afternoon , the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated , which can already have significant successes .	-4.2388
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association .	-3.0266
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed-Hospital in Nouakchott in 2004 .	-3.0396
As a result , further cooperation was developed , and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the ground on several journeys .	-6.3612
During the speeches , pictures of the stakes were shown on a large screen so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the aforementioned actions .	-5.6726
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown .	-2.3607
It is a former federal border protection vehicle .	-1.6286
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had suggested equipping this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning to work with the association in consulting capacity , according to Henne .	-5.3390
In 2008 , the Schleeh Room from Baiersbronn created a sickness station in Socogim , a miserable district on the edge of the capital - voluntary .	-5.9318
Henne also mentioned a new mother child hospital in Nouakchott .	-1.7710
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be downgraded in Nagold .	-4.0616
You learn a lot in Africa as a medical practitioner , according to Henne , for example , deceleration against burn-out .	-4.8296
Due to the political unrest in the country , it was not possible to travel as much as planned , but many medical professionals came to Germany to hospitalize in different areas .	-14.8290
In addition , containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa , such as medical equipment , medicines , association materials , hospital beds and glasses in March of this year .	-4.9153
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stall and describing the experiences of the regular musicians who traditionally support the association during their journey to Mauritania .	-5.8102
As his personal motivation , he called his work on auditing as a young Member of Parliament .	-3.7559
When he realized how much money was lost on the road , he decided to help Africans control a grassroots budget .	-3.2075
Fuchtel also stressed that global economies also demand global love for human beings .	-3.0577
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think .	-2.0627
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa .	-1.9942
Coulson set telephone hacking for checking a tip .	-2.7935
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson supposedly used “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke .	-4.9950
Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.5105
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack and persecute Pawlby ’ s voicemails , but Coulson also called them and left news like the court heard .	-4.3877
“ According to the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office , Coulson , who is now the editor of NotW , is no one who stands in front of people ’ s home and hopes to catch them for fresh action , but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction , ” said Edis .	-5.8987
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively : telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-2.9553
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.2813
Obviously he knows of the second , of monitoring , otherwise it can not be .	-2.9139
What about the first ?	-0.8555
Do he know about phone hacking ?	-2.0082
He disputes that , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-3.4412
Rumours about an affair of Clarkes were first taken up by NotW ’ s feature editorial , when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told : “ Do not waste your time , it is with Charles . ”	-4.6828
A volume of voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was ensured in August 2006 in Mulcaire 's apartment .	-3.1471
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects ” .	-3.5455
At the time when the searches ran , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking them for information about them , Edis declared .	-4.4653
Meanwhile , former chief exporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Pawlby movements .	-2.7883
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow , which I would like to talk about with Charles . ”	-3.5722
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-3.5117
On Thursday , the jury heard that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he himself lied with the accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at the time .	-4.6226
Coulson and Brooks dispute having conspired others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .	-3.2135
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking .	-1.9192
In protest against the planned wealthy tax , French football will indeed go through the first strike since 1972 .	-4.5042
A conciliation meeting ends without results .	-2.9568
In the conflict over the Rich Tax , the French government and professional football have manoeuvred themselves into a dead end after a failed conc.	-12.2153
President Fran<unk>ois Hollande received representatives of associations and associations on Thursday at the Paris <unk>lysée Palace and also sounded to hear their complaints . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-13.4072
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 % tax on income of more than one million euros per year , which all firms in the country will pay for two years from 2014 .	-4.5199
The other side also remained tough .	-3.1581
The strike announced at the end of November will now be pushed through , announced by the chief association of the professional clubs ( UCPF ) , Jean-Pierre Louvel .	-4.4237
The match days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 , scheduled for 29 November and 2 December , are therefore out of date .	-11.8642
Gechingen : No absolute protection possible	-1.9582
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage " , Mayor Jens Häu<unk>ler opened the citizens ' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-4.6567
About 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , to ask questions , to express concerns and to bring forward ideas .	-4.9262
Häusler made it clear : " The ultimate decisions are made by the members of the municipal council " .	-3.9141
The flood that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009 , unprepared , had been a serious event that raised the question of protective measures for the future , according to Häu<unk>ler .	-4.5008
A river survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.7632
" The protection of as many buildings as possible is the goal " , says Häu<unk>ler .	-3.4329
Based on the planning of the protection against a flood that is expected every 100 years , according to the German weather service .	-12.6104
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .	-2.6736
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-3.4030
The water masses , which caused considerable damage in 2009 in Gechingen , corresponded to a 1000-year flood . flo. . . . . . . . . . . . .	-15.5139
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement " , says Häu<unk>ler .	-2.8990
In order to protect HQ 100aClimate , approximately EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality being able to count on state subsidies of around 70 percent .	-6.2826
Häu<unk>ler pointed out , however , that promotion only exists if an overall concept is implemented . .	-4.4174
The municipality needs the participation of its citizens .	-4.5826
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.8868
At best , implementation can begin in 2016 .	-2.3552
Among other things , the protection concept , which was presented last week in the municipal council ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the flow of the Irm river from the Stammheim Valley .	-11.0726
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns .	-3.1430
Amongst other things , it was questioned why no more dams and restraint basins were planned to protect the place .	-5.0545
Gregor Kühn , specialist planner of the engineering agency Wald and Corbe from Higelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in sum .	-5.5933
In addition , it is important to find the most economical solution , according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe .	-3.4769
There was a lot of displeasure among the riders of the Altort who , even in normal thunderstorms , suffer from congestion of the channel network .	-8.7555
The problem is known in the administration and initial measures have already been taken .	-3.3187
Häu<unk>ler pointed out , however , that the channel system guidelines are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed .	-5.3846
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain could be coped with .	-4.7278
Making sewage channels larger would devour millions .	-2.8562
Gravely injured after collision	-3.7534
On the early Friday afternoon on the Landesstra<unk>e 44 near Revensdorf two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision .	-3.8878
The police immediately blocked the road completely , but could say little about the accident .	-4.4722
However , there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first .	-3.5384
It is clear that the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf headed for Revensdorf and the 38-year-old Gettorf man met her with his Hyundai .	-4.6391
Both vehicles collapsed , and the woman was so heavily trapped that the fire brigade needed nearly half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck .	-4.9530
The actual cause of the accident remained unresolved at first .	-3.5969
Both accidents came to nearby hospitals .	-2.1750
The track remained closed for about two hours .	-2.8092
He could be called the US Dostoyevski .	-3.1955
Philip K. Dick was a god seeker , a metaphysist , his novels and narratives also have something serial .	-3.0314
Amazing the kinship in the outside : the stunning eyes , the beard , the high forehead .	-3.6763
And as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski , with his massive oeuvre , is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul , Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet , which is well known at home .	-5.3473
Some titles have appeared in Heyne Verlag , the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand .	-14.4917
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security madness , and the belief of being chosen .	-3.4837
Dick had experience of God , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .	-3.1212
Perhaps he was crazy , had drugs added to his brain .	-2.1748
He captured early that the computers are divinities .	-10.4905
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine , the creator from his creation .	-2.8366
That is the Blade Runner problem .	-1.7562

The " Minority Report " dates back to 1956 , in contrast to the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals .	-11.0552
The principle of pre-crime is developed here , " pre-crime " , that is , what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House .	-3.6401
In Dick 's world , which is appalling to us , mutants look to the future - and the police accesses .	-4.5424
" We collect individuals who have not violated any law , " says the head of the authority .	-3.1346
" We grab them before they can commit a violent crime " .	-2.8362
And : ' There are no serious criminals in our society , for which we have a prison camp full of pesudo criminals ' .	-5.2411
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .	-4.0311
Dick ’ s narrative looks like the blueprint for the anti-terrorism laws and the NSA ’ s hearing noise .	-4.3345
Antizipation of the attack : Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice also works .	-3.6261
But Dick ’ s story is not finished .	-2.6301
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state .	-3.6978
Then the supervisor is monitored and transferred to a future crime .	-3.8038
The system rotates through .	-1.4464
It is perfect , but it lies .	-1.4842
It invents its own prerequisites .	-1.4643
Not only does errors and sacrifices take place but builds on them .	-3.8365
The system creates the danger it is fighting .	-2.6701

Merkel Spawning in Russia	-4.0452
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US affair of Chancellor Angela Merkel .	-4.0356
Representatives of the German Bundesanwaltschaft could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally , the Interfax agency reported .	-4.0481
Previously , Hans-Christian Ströbele , a member of the Greens , met in Moscow as the first German politician to talk to him about the affair yesterday .	-4.5072
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia for state surveillance	-2.5110
On a mild day at the end of August , a German police helicopter flew deep across the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main , Germany ’ s financial capital .	-2.8109
On the instruction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German Internal Security Service , he should photograph the roof of the US outpost , which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-4.6696
According to the German media , the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .	-3.9445
In September , James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted once again that the US did not use foreign espionage to “ steal foreign firms ’ trade secrets on behalf of US firms to expand their international competitiveness or profit . ”	-4.4706
But since Edward Snowden , the former whistleblower , began publishing his fillhorn of US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders have no longer been sure whether they can take the director at his word .	-5.4410
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought corporate paranoia to a new peak because of state surveillance .	-4.6004
The barrel to overflow may have been the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s telephone was mad for ten years .	-4.9482
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then corporate leaders are certainly also potential goals .	-4.3411
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent .	-2.0310
I believe it is conceivable that these data should be used for mutual benefit .	-3.0861
“ Germany must wake up , ” explains Oliver Grün , President of the BITMi , who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .	-2.7376
German companies believe that the US now represented almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey published by the EY consultant in July .	-4.7186
However , the documents leaked by Snowden have not yet proved that the US has passed on the secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .	-5.6391
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and reduce its dependence on the US .	-3.0870

“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” said Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , to FoxNews.com.	-2.4287
They would never have believed that he had died as the Sheriff concluded . .	-3.5096
“ They believe that there is no logic in violating the laws of physics and common sense , ” says Crump .	-4.1045

“ Their son went to school to learn and returned to the corpse , ” he commented .	-4.0922
US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson 's death , as a number of important issues remain unresolved .	-3.4952
What was the cause of death ?	-0.8285
Is his death due to a crime ?	-1.2077
This explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-2.2201
I follow the facts in which direction they lead .	-2.3077
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.5972
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.6846
Moore explained to reporters that initial autopsy suggests that Johnson had died as a result of a “ position-driven stitching . ”	-11.2168
A second autopsy , however , has caused another cause of death , according to Moore .	-3.3270
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-2.1287

CDC Publish Allergy Policy for Schools	-1.7913
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for the handling of children 's food allergies in schools .	-2.8747
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government , as the number of children with compulsory education with food allergies increases .	-4.8171
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.9570
According to the CDC , the distribution of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.7463
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the body of teachers and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-4.8899
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the EpiPen brand ’ s auto injection is most commonly used – to deal with a potentially deadly oversensitivity reaction .	-4.2352
Legislators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools can keep epinephrine easier .	-4.4404
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms referred to by children who have an allergic reaction .	-11.6265
Children may say , “ It feels like something is pushing on my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels like a hair lies on it , ” or “ cribbling my tongue . ”	-4.7064
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender indefinitely ” .	-6.8049
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third gender for children born with non-clear genitals .	-2.6568
Newborn people are no longer assigned rigidly male or female .	-3.2299
According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare gender for such children , but can state “ indefinitely ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .	-5.1043
The aim of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions on gender allocation operations in newborn people and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-5.8771
An intersexual person said , according to BBC years later , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”	-2.9076
I maintain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars .	-3.1341
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children is born neither as a boy nor as a girl every year .	-3.8582
They are among the intersexuals , a group that falls under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( egg sticks or testing ) or unusually developed genitals .	-4.7955
Valais Simpson was perhaps intersexual .	-2.3066
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible and not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding – if any – to take an operation .	-6.5354
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-2.9420
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.2409
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not , ” he said .	-3.1624
You can assign a sex without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop .	-5.1490
The scientific data on how a child evolves its gender identity at all is not very accurate .	-3.4402
No one knows why it is happening .	-1.7154
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-2.3078
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people , because their status is not gender-based , but depends on their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .	-4.8484
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals , or in chromosome structures and hormones .	-4.2491
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender people face in working life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .	-3.8337
Young boys who do not agree with the gender picture now have a special camp .	-4.3861
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to indicate male , female or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-3.8407

In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-1.9409
The US Catholic Online website has also opposed German law , on the grounds that , “ If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , then we twist two more pillars of civilization . ”	-5.7140
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a sex at birth .	-12.8187
“ Even without further restrictions , parental life is stressful enough , especially if one does not know the sex of one ’ s own child , ” she said to the parent ’ s website .	-5.2662
Children need stability and security .	-0.6863
Historically , children born with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodits , after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .	-3.1907
Just ten years ago , medicine considered gender to be something that can be erased and then rebuilt .	-13.3856
But , in the meantime , the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned , after it is now known how complex gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when it grows up with the gender they allocate .	-6.0812
“ In the middle of the 20th century , it was called a “ psychiatric emergency , ” Drescher said .	-3.6974
When such a child was born , they called not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-3.1021
The dominant theory about the treatment of children with non-clear genitals is based on John Money of John Hopkins University , who believed that gender was formable .	-4.9911
He shaped the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental stimulus – such as parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , shaping whether a person considers himself male or female .	-5.7857
But in a 1966 case known as “ John / Joan ” , his theories became controversial .	-2.8142
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from the child in a plague circumcision , castrated the child completely and also removed his testimony and then raised him as a girl .	-6.6770
" Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , which he was not , " says Drescher .	-3.3081
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .	-2.6449
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-2.1334
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practise this model .	-2.2754
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the arrival of the Internet , survivors of these gender operations came to the public , who are “ not happy with the result . ”	-4.2160
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old Montana author born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-3.0139
Doctors were not clear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-4.5775
So his external organ and testimony were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl .	-4.0441
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.9774
“ I knew I ’ m not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com .	-3.0680
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.7924
At the age of 18 he should be given a vaginal plastic .	-3.0801
But as he was depressive and knew that something was not right , he demanded his medical acts .	-3.8338
What he found out was shocking .	-1.0220
I was sterilized at my birth – and nobody ever told me .	-3.2496
Bruce was born with a DSD in which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals .	-3.3814
After learning the truth , he returned to male identity , received testosterone injections and removed his breasts .	-3.7461
The surgery has made it infertile .	-2.9489
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-2.9545
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , CEO of the Advocates for Informed Choice legal group in California , worries that the German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.0969
“ Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to “ not assign ” the child , she explained .	-5.1099
We fear that this will encourage intervention .	-2.3371
We think it would be better to allocate the male or female gender and then wait .	-2.8176
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.8244
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender . ”	-3.5969
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender , ” she explained .	-2.3565
The German law is about assigning birth .	-2.8085
This is not a battle to force small children at this time .	-3.3165
When they grow up , they can decide their own body .	-3.5318
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast radiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the German law “ enforceable ” both parents and children . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.2845
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete Androgen Resistance .	-2.4702
Due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone , catie developed female characteristics .	-3.4470
It has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-1.9466
Katie 29 is married today ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry .	-4.1542
She is infertile , but hopes to get a child through adoption or surrogacy .	-3.3650
“ The law gives parents room , which means that they do not have to make rushed decisions , ” said Baratz .	-4.5850
It gives them time to make different tests and clarify things , giving them time before they write “ male ” or “ female ” .	-3.8269
In this way , everything is fine – you pull the child large and love it .	-4.4971
One has a wonderful baby and enjoys parental happiness .	-2.8467
And one does not need to hasten an operation that can no longer be undone .	-4.7017
“ This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are turning around because they believe they are not doing the right thing , ” she explained .	-5.0919
Ultimately , the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that is wonderful .	-3.9430
This enables children to make the decision themselves .	-2.5570
Unknown injured girls by shot from car	-11.0488
Unknown people injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shots from a car .	-3.9597
On Thursday evening in Genthin , the perpetrators had probably fired an air pressure weapon on a group of children .	-3.3147
This was announced by the police in Castle .	-3.5875
The girl was easily injured on the left wall .	-2.2509
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital .	-2.6169
The shot came from a small car passing by a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-3.1635

Until now , the Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-2.9982
The officials were called only twice to jealousy children who threw them against house facades .	-4.2446
Since the owners recognized this in good time and removed the egg remains immediately , no material damage should have occurred .	-4.9103
In addition , some New Year ’ s Böllers have probably been ignited in the city area , but there has also been no material damage .	-7.2779
A resident in the Bischof-Friendorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with cloppaper and that his wheel hides were stopped .	-6.1772

Housing with a future perspective	-3.1572
Actually Waltraud Ries lives dreamy .	-3.1425
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.8160
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-2.9511
" Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders ? " , Waltraud Ries asks and points to a fat spider on the door frame .	-4.2230
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.3221
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.8527
The reason , however , is not a spider phobia , but the concern that the many staircases to the house and in the apartment can no longer be managed at the age explains them .	-7.9108
In addition , since a meniskus operation , the mid-fifties have experienced what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap .	-5.0129
Recently , a book of her appeared on the subject of ' Happy dwelling at age - What is the best living form for me ? ' .	-6.2831
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn 't go at all at the age ' , she begins to tell .	-4.8693
When she moved with her husband to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.1518
Today , at the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about this .	-3.1638
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who are dealing with the subject of ' living at age ' .	-4.6831
Most displace it as long as it goes .	-3.4412
Old are always only the others ' , she says smuggling .	-3.6846
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do we worry about it .	-4.7984
" Then it can be too late , " said Ries .	-3.9653
In her book , the interior design presents 17 living models for self-determined living at age .	-3.9988
" Which form of living you choose is always an individual decision , " she explains .	-4.3085
D i e solution do not exist for age .	-2.0231
Even those who can afford the residence of age in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can become ill .	-4.5080
And : ' Without a good knowledge of the national language , one can also unite in the Dolce Vita , ' the specialist book author gives willingness to resign .	-6.8129
Among their models are classic support models , alternative living forms or the often cited pensioners ' WG .	-5.7215
At age , everyone has their ticks and mocks in this way .	-5.7129
" For me , however , this would not be a community of residents , " she says with an eye twinker .	-7.3123
Already not like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .	-4.1757
" At age you just need your retreat rooms , " said Ries .	-4.8415
However , the author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior residence can still function .	-4.8648
But this must be different from the classical student WG .	-5.5860
Sometimes you just want your peace , " she believes .	-4.8495
With this opinion , it is not alone , at least in the capital of the country .	-4.3674
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as it goes ' , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the civil service Leben at the age of the state capital .	-5.4808
Your service advises people on the subject of ' become older ' .	-4.5329
That is why older people in particular would often take advantage of inconveniences and restrictions only to remain in their familiar environment , which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-5.9609
There are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible today .	-3.7987
Ries recommends that all those who deal with the age-oriented restructuring of their house or apartment should first inform themselves thoroughly and not commission the first craftsman .	-7.7155
Today there are also specialists for the reconstruction of old buildings .	-4.8391
Even in the rental apartment , one or two of these things can be realized , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior design will be clarified .	-7.0275
But it is not always possible to renovate the existing apartment according to the age and thus without barriers , even if it is still so beautiful .	-13.5409
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience .	-2.7474
Although one could install a stairlift inside the apartment , the path that is also paved with stairs to the apartment door would be a far greater obstacle .	-6.1261
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-8.8488
Before moving it greets you more than in front of the spider on your door .	-4.3820
The US wants to continue prosecuting Snowden	-2.5599
The US has not changed its position as former US intelligence worker Edward Snowden .	-2.6548
He will continue to be accused of passing on unauthorised secret information .	-4.0606
Thus , he must face criminal proceedings in the US , said the US State Department spokesman , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-4.3568
The recent statements by Snowden would not change that either .	-3.4375
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele called on the US not to continue to threaten him with punishment .	-3.8081
Psaki stressed that what Ströbel said was a parliamentarian , not a German member of the government .	-4.3356
Intelligence enforcement enforcement agency Edward Snowden is basically ready to discuss with German authorities .	-5.5231
But first he wants to clarify his situation .	-3.1044
This was made clear by the former NSA staff sought by the USA in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , Bundestag and the Federal Advocate .	-5.8960
The letter has the following wording :	-3.0328
To the competents	-3.0121
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .	-2.7674
I am known as Edward Joseph Snowden and used to be contracted or directly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-3.9458
In the course of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government , which led me to act on the basis of a moral duty .	-5.1392
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hate that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-4.0072
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.7669
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the United States and elsewhere .	-2.3337
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-embracing surveillance , which is not accountable to anyone , as a public service .	-4.2663
These spy revelations led to many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public confidence .	-3.9888
The benefits for society derived from these findings are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks involved in purchasing have been clearly reduced .	-5.9475
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat Dissens as a trust break and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political expression .	-5.2810
Still , speaking the truth is not a crime .	-2.3898
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will abandon this damaging attitude .	-3.6223
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts relating to the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-4.9081
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law , which protects us all .	-4.2982

" The building is in good hands , " says Winterlingen 's mayor Michael Maier .	-1.7144
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in the Gartenstra<unk>e to a private person .	-3.1497
The municipal council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part .	-3.9888
The building changed its owner at a " reasonable " price .	-2.0790
" The community is satisfied , " Maier emphasizes .	-2.7334
The budget had EUR 100 000 .	-2.9692
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .	-2.4439
It is right for the mayor that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , look at the garden and clear the walking path .	-6.3915
" This effort is now gone , " says Maier .	-2.9060

Report : Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-1.5897
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton , according to the New York Ti.	-2.9840
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann ’ s long-awaited work about the 2012 campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-2.9444
The Times is a copy of the soon published book , and it reported on Thursday evening that president ’ s top advisers “ held extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s dwindling hope of re-election looks better if he drops bids .	-5.9774
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ national policy correspondent , the book thoroughly reflects the history of the efforts of leaders in the campaign and the White House , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice-President .	-4.7430
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.4907
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former White House ’ s senior adviser , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change .	-3.7212
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids despite its “ close , personal relationship , ” before finally opting against such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-5.3375
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.5805
“ I said a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained to the magazine . .	-4.1213
It must be remembered that the President had terrible polls at the time , so we thought , “ For God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-4.4414
While Daley called the investigations “ due diligence , ” Martin told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a train pays off in terms of the ballot box .	-10.3411
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups unless you think seriously about something , ” Martin said on AC360 .	-3.8068
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange .	-2.5197
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change .	-2.9865
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew .	-20.8193
Martin added that “ double down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations had reached Obama ’ s desk .	-3.0403
Cooper asked Martin whether he thought seriously that Obama knew nothing about investigating whether to drop Biden in the elections .	-4.3477
“ Possible , ” Martin replied .	-1.4312
What happens on the way with my email ?	-2.3673
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter .	-2.3310
Was the letter secret technically implemented when designing the Internet service ?	-6.3141
In the conception of early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-3.5906
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not taken care to create a stable foundation for a hearing-safe exchange of letters .	-5.0470
Therefore , a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.2304
When user " Anna " sends an email to " Benni " , are the machines of the two connected directly ?	-4.0965
The email program or browser from Anna sends in the first step the mail to the mail server of their service provider .	-4.2111
For example , if it has a GMail account , it would be Google .	-2.5999
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses .	-1.9240
On the route , the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet .	-4.4834
Bennie can then call the content from his provider .	-2.6520
Will conventional e-mails be read on their way through the network ?	-3.6241
Most of the mails are read several times by software robots .	-9.9003
The sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail is an attachment .	-4.9889
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems .	-2.5071
In addition , providers check whether this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted out into a spam folder .	-5.6478
Do the robots have another task ?	-2.0829
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.7863
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip , Google can display appropriate links to holiday offers .	-4.3439
Do unknown people also read the e-mails ?	-4.5346
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading a mail is extremely low .	-3.9499
In theory , however , this is possible .	-2.3611
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.9770
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails .	-3.6569
In addition , there are possible illegal spam actions .	-9.3251
Is it possible to protect emails from reading ?	-2.7933
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an email can be effectively encrypted against fellow readers .	-4.0556
It is also possible to obscure the metadata of e-mail communication with a great deal of technical effort , so that it is not even easy to recognize who communicated with whom .	-6.0165
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.8380
According to an August 2013 study by Convios Consulting , Yahoo and Google play a minor role in mainly private postal boxes .	-4.5697
While the shares of Yahoo mail had fallen last , GMail could increase significantly from Google .	-4.3161
Mother in the forest scarred and pension collected	-4.6017
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-2.5092
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care .	-2.9781
In order to continue collecting pensions and care , a 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations .	-4.5201
First of all , he concealed the death of the 89-year-old , and then he cut the money for more than a year and a half .	-5.6963
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-3.3520
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.9629
The man was suspected as early as May : at that time it was noticed that the needy mother no longer needed medicines .	-5.5218
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-2.3835
Because officials were curious about this , they continued to identify .	-4.4205
It turned out that the two had lived in a common flat for more than 15 years and that he had maintained it last .	-5.9534
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.5125
According to the police , an obduction showed no evidence of a capital crime .	-2.7305
Looking for ice cream that shines in the dark ?	-3.1340
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice in the dark , using jellies .	-3.4185
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of marine animals and created a shining delicacy .	-3.5210
The idea came to him after reading a research on jellies and convincing Chinese scientists to produce the bright protein artificially .	-4.2332
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue , raising the pH value in the protein and triggering the light .	-4.0035
Chris explains that the eating ice reacts to the warmth of the mouth and shines – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-3.8384
Charlie , founder of the ice-cream company “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious ” , says : “ The product is incredible , but still at a very early stage of production , and so you get two grams of it for <unk> 200 . ”	-4.8986
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-1.8853
When the mouth heats the protein , the pH value increases and the ice shines .	-2.6427
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed to us ideal to put it on the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-4.3051
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced , because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.6814
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.9178
But for that it tastes delicious .	-2.9358
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-2.7778
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.4063
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.0658
This is , in itself , impossible because of the break of light caused by the ice crystal , which consists of ice cream ; but I suspect we find a way to do it .	-6.0574
The ice cream uses the fluorescent characteristics of a jelly artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-2.7545
After six days of play , the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League .	-3.5876
Now it 's time for the team of Ingo Ehlers to join the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-4.9172
With this game the season starts again for us .	-2.9216
" I hope that we finally have the head free " , Ehler 's behavior is optimistic .	-4.2233
At last , with the exception of the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme , he has his entire cadre at his disposal .	-10.9543
Daverden also relies on tempo game .	-4.9547
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.4716
First and foremost , however , we need to increase our coverage , which has left anything but a secure impression .	-5.7653
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season win against Nordhorn .	-4.0713
The game was of course a house number .	-1.4970
But that is why we are not the favorite yet , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-5.0302
However , Panitz now wants to start a series in Morsum .	-3.2705
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing .	-2.4865
For this purpose , the A-youth Joost Winds<unk> , who is active with double game rights at the A-Youth League HC Bremen , celebrates his season battle .	-7.0667
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.9050
Halloween 2013 : In Numbers	-1.1623
When I was small , Halloween had some magic .	-1.7521
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress up for the neighbourhood .	-3.0588
Today I have become a Halloween muffle .	-2.9369
Over the last two years I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home , and I do not think I will do so this year either .	-5.4168
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep with regard to Halloween .	-2.4556
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the United States Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-7.6508
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-3.2542
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the USD 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-2.9462
This year , unlived items are the last cry .	-4.7162
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes , they can now embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .	-3.8403
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk space men will put it into the instagram feeds this year .	-3.9973
According to Google , the most sought costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.2765
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.1319
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise .	-3.8534
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the NRF .	-2.1303
These are a lot of “ hot dogs ” .	-2.3469
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not pretty .	-7.4910
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-1.5945
This is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate rules , hatchers , bonbonbons and rubber bears .	-3.7202
So good news for the US Department of Trade , 41 million people who cross the quarters with the saying “ sweet or saures . ”	-5.7120
In fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not deceive ourselves – eat .	-3.3083
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn , but 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers .	-3.7623
That is about nine billion maize grains .	-2.0164
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.5935
Nothing else belongs to Halloween than houses where it spits .	-3.8290
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is , by the way , a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock . ”	-3.8079
In fact , there are 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States , which generate $ 500 million in revenue , according to America Haunts , including the wonderful photos on which you are pinking into the pants and then putting your friends on Facebook , where you will not get rid of them again , and then leaving a comment on the type you stand on , such as “ nice facial expression . ”	-7.9105
But let us finally get to the pumpkins .	-3.2557
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great pumpkin when we were children , and the cutting of a pumpkin is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we made from small .	-4.0971
Fortunately , the “ baby in pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to pinterest , so most of us grew up with cutting the pumpkin and not sitting there .	-4.5388
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , according to the US Census Bureau .	-2.1088
The pumpkins , slowly rotting in the foreground , probably come from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this this .	-17.6497
If you want to score the right points , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut something pretty from their 921 kilo pumpkin .	-3.8785
Housing fire in Helmbrecht : Rescue forces mount grinded corpses .	-6.0246
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmbricht on late Thursday evening .	-4.1213
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on the night to Friday .	-3.6479
The rescue forces are carrying a grinded body from the house . .	-5.1948
Rescue forces found a grinded corpse in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbricht .	-5.3310
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-3.4725
Late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.7013
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames hit out of a window .	-3.1760
The forces went to the apartment and found the corpse in a room .	-2.6748
This and another room burned out completely .	-8.3747
The whole ground floor has been damaged .	-2.5467
All other inhabitants had not been at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued to explain .	-3.4699
The building is no longer habitable for the time being .	-3.4032
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .	-2.1675
Germany ’ s largest church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor ’ s profession .	-3.5320
The background is a possible parish shortage : the Evangelisch-Lutheran Church of the Landeskirche Hannover expects the number of its currently approximately 1,800 pastors to be halved by 2030 .	-5.6099
For today 's young people , the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-3.8827
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day-to-day course itself .	-4.8156
With Burfien , the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor in a full post to inspire young people to study theology .	-4.8136
Currently , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology .	-12.6778
Burfien attributes this to the process of decoration : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.4795
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.6976
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.0054
Pastors could be very close to people as a pastor .	-3.6957
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it .	-2.9855
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer for this .	-3.5477
That is what the young people of today are talking about , not just career , but sensible work .	-5.2498
According to the Landeskirche , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are retired each year .	-3.1982
At the same time , approximately 40 graduates of theology study are starting their vicariat .	-4.8480
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , Emsland and the Wendland , it can be difficult to fill jobs in the future .	-4.2265
Burfien wants , among other things , to organize study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-4.5604
Theology studies offer a broad range of education .	-4.3821
You can even become a federal president .	-3.3345
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-0.7450
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free speaker system . a .	-12.8062
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with support for bowler workshops and logistical support to vehicle inlays between events .	-5.1239
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , says : “ The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.7820
They are not all experienced racers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world class events .	-4.1323
We are delighted to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will open up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare newcomers for the strain and reality of Rally Raid .	-5.0961
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – that will be an entertaining championship .	-3.1959
In addition , the Defender Challenge has a training and testing day in February and the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.3780
Fire brigade called to rescue a bitch that fixed 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock edge in a quarry .	-5.2228
Ruby Cockerspaniel had gone away after a smaller traffic accident .	-8.9249
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her miserable location .	-3.8127
Fire fighters rolled off the rocky wall and saved the dog from safe death .	-4.5219
The fire brigade succeeded in securing a bitch that was fixed on a 15-metre high edge in a rock wall .	-5.7499
The nine months old Cockerspaniel female Ruby went away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-4.4034
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom belongs to the dog , came to the quarry of Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-4.0742
They had desperately sought their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when they had escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-4.7590
About 14 : 15 p.m. on Wednesday a walker who performed his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre high paragraph in the quarry .	-5.1971
The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to rescue Ruby , which was then transported up in a dog box .	-3.9169
Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous position .	-10.9833
It was in the middle of the rocky wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-9.9795
She did not move any muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen .	-8.8398
But now it is doing well .	-2.5533
She then eaten some dog cakes .	-2.7130
This was a rather unusual effort .	-2.7396
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-9.6812
Peter Lau , the technical rescue team ’ s specialist , said , “ Ruby had a huge gap . ”	-3.4167
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.8284
Ruby was brought to the veterinary surgeon , but he did not notice anything other than exhaustion and dehydration .	-5.2800
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said , “ watching the rescue was frightening . ”	-3.0898
I could not believe that she was really there above .	-3.1466
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .	-2.2322
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-3.4105
The fire fighters have done great things .	-2.5985
It was really courageous what they did .	-2.3406
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.9035
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that she would fall down , but she remained above . ”	-2.8908
The fire fighters were great .	-1.8422
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.5319
Mick Jagger explains that he never got Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-3.4978
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-3.6425
Perry declared that she had dinner with the aldryer , and that “ he hadn ’ t bothered me when I was 18 . ”	-5.8543
She added : “ This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.7063
In a statement , a representative Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denies that he has ever made attempts at rapprochement with Katy Perry . ”	-4.2874
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.3106
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year .	-2.9606
Her new album “ Prism ” came to the top of this week .	-5.7244
George Kerevan : European Unbundling gives the Scots the choice	-2.0913
A new day , a new history of horror for independence .	-8.2695
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.3171
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian wall .	-3.4595
Indeed , the Strathclyde template highlighted the possible economic benefits that would bring greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , this did not matter in the headlines .	-5.2639
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often abide by their strict rules when it is cheaper for them .	-4.8742
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , continued non-compliance with Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what one really wants from the Scots .	-4.3350
So no story .	-2.7335
And one that has come so long ago that it is already a fossil : for the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” -duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.9375
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-3.7609
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe ?	-2.4691
Why exchange the London yoke against that of Brussels , especially now ?	-2.2463
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled .	-3.6373
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-2.1559
Throughout the EU , parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro on board as a common currency are gaining ground .	-4.2072
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany – founded this year – won nearly five million votes in the federal election in September , effectively expelling the Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .	-4.8128
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.6985
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.7324
Because of the rigorous austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , in conjunction with the straitjacket to which the national economy is forced by adherence to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.8272
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece .	-2.6641
Instead , the Eurosystem has stuck its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that way .	-4.3975
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-3.4048
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – stimulated by Berlin .	-2.1515
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems is a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.3939
As a result of the ‘ green ’ energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and fourfold for gas compared to the United States .	-4.0851
This is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-2.7379
All of the world ’ s wage records do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-9.8111
As a result , a revolt is emerging , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-3.0464
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-3.5112
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe , with the struggling French economy struggling with .	-4.4322
As a result , Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , thereby pointing the ruling Socialists to place three .	-4.2771
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that division on the right would automatically bring benefits to the left .	-5.0400
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French working class ?	-3.1534
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.6433
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-4.3849
That is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-3.7433
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” which General de Gaulle favored .	-3.0309
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.7078
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the US .	-3.6720
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain .	-2.5066
Where is Scotland in all this ?	-2.6215
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) small England .	-2.8654
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hide where .	-3.7599
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a looser European association if we retain our own currency .	-4.0837
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.3903
Otherwise , we should consider equating Norway and retaining our economic independence .	-2.1730
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts to which Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible .	-4.0698
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now , only to have austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .	-3.9792
Early Puberty : Faster to grow up	-3.7456
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers , as studies show .	-3.4862
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty .	-3.1553
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-2.0023
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty .	-1.8197
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys .	-2.5564
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialising in child health and family issues .	-2.9348
Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows breasts and shamehairs at the age of seven or eight ?	-10.4349
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Children ’ s Association in Orlando , Florida , this week , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-3.8595
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is now rapidly entering , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-4.2688
Obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hairs , and body smell , are shown in girls earlier .	-6.0045
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarch ( appearance of the first rule bleeding ) in the last 40 years .	-4.5019
In the United States , the average age age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.9186
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to reach the menarchy , ” Kaplowitz said , also author of the book “ Early Puberty with Girls : The essential advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem ” .	-10.6459
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-2.3787
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early ” that the breast magnification is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-5.2624
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor .	-2.5667
With faster progress , tests could be displayed by an endicronologist to prevent serious problems such as tumours or cysts .	-4.6451
There are treatment methods to delay an early menstruation and to defend another consequence : the premature aging of bones , which can ultimately lead to growth impediment and thus small growth in adults ’ body .	-6.7232
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .	-3.6272
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.0720
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he acknowledges , “ suppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls , unlike their peers . ”	-4.7270
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.9564
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or about how to handle the hygienic side , ” Kaplowitz said .	-3.1129
“ It was a shock , ” a woman remembers , whose daughter got her days with ten .	-10.4777
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-2.9955
She came home frightened and excited by the school because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-3.3849
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.1604
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs , chemicals in the environment or sexual embassies in the media are causal .	-3.4885
Young people , like girls , come to puberty ear.	-3.8725
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.4959
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine , which creates a link between body fat and admission to puberty .	-4.3259
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.4577
In that country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers .	-3.1782
There are different explanations .	-1.8643
Global , early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-3.1338
Another mystery : although boys have already grown face and shame hair , the trend towards a full-scale earlier puberty is not as strong as girls .	-5.8059
Other doctors at the AAP conference highlighted the complexity of the issue .	-2.4065
The emergence of acne and shaman hair is common even in babies and infants .	-3.7955
“ We must be careful as we identify the real beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-2.7475
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician how to talk to their child .	-3.1432
“ This can mean that you have to talk sooner than expected , ” Kaplowitz said .	-10.5129
If you stay calm , the child usually responds well .	-13.1114
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than thought .	-4.0855
Jumbo manufacturers dispute over seating width in the face of large orders .	-4.1138
There has been a debate between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of tourist seats on long-haul flights , which is the tone of a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-5.3337
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who strive most for airlines , but this declared space is the key to the efficiency assertions of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co aircraft .	-6.2020
This week , Airbus demanded a industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US Archrival Boeing says that airlines should decide .	-4.7154
The debate comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft , and record orders are expected at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-4.8418
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are ranks of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the stated economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design should deliver .	-5.6053
Boeing claims that his modernized “ 777X ” comprises 406 seats in the tourist class , which are over 17 inches wide , allowing 10 per row .	-5.5951
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 passengers in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-17.0056
Aircraft giants frequently split blows over technical details through advertising in the specialist press .	-5.5436
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X with more than 100 orders is expected to make the race .	-4.0129
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing donors a picture of three people sitting squashed together in a restaurant , titled : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-6.0760
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats tighter than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus sales manager John Leahy .	-3.0459
Given changed nutritional habits , people are getting thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-3.4473
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul journey , and at the end of the century , the weight of the male average American increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to the US Department of Health .	-4.4248
The waist size of the male average American in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm , according to US health statistics .	-3.4366
Airbus says that its rival adheres to a 1950s seat concept , when the average body size of the newly baptized “ jet set ” was narrower .	-4.2096
According to Airbus , studies showed that an additional inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 percent .	-4.4981
Boeing disputes Airbus ’ figures on the seats and says that it is not the manufacturer ’ s discretion to decide how airlines strike a balance between flight tariffs and . . . . . . . . . . . . were . . .	-15.6753
The company also explains that , according to research , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seating width .	-4.3383
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains Kent Craver von Boeing ’ s flight cabin expert .	-4.5457
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.0938
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.5061
Passengers are concerned with greater freedom of elbow , but manufacturers are increasingly faced with an issue that can affect sales .	-5.0201
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-4.7949
As Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets .	-3.0192
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.0585
The statements by Boeing on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X , with its ten seats per row , is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-4.3562
The increased cost per unit is still lower than that of currently used machines with ten seats per row .	-3.8542
“ Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus .	-3.8149
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 77s indicate that many passengers have chosen the closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-5.4556
“ Eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , expert in cabin facilities , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-4.1816
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select .	-9.4186
The world ’ s travelling jet sellers even bear the tape to measure the facility at the competition .	-5.8038
Even if they offer comfort , all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.3960
Airbus has a ten-seater A350 but has not yet sold , according to its own statement .	-4.0353
Until recently , Airbus has stressed the importance of making cabins more customizable and offering wide seats at the corridors for some jets .	-5.0242
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be wasted , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.5727
New anti-nicotine vaccine could break the pleasure of smoking out of .	-3.7764
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-1.6619
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-2.1706
Before human testing , further attempts are needed , which may take a few years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-4.2662
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market , but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” says Cornell .	-5.0836
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified in such a way that it contains genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-3.0629
The virus selectively infects liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-2.2363
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high .	-12.2379
In trials , vaccinated mice , to which nicotine was administered , retained its normal level of activity .	-3.6362
By contrast , mice without vaccination would have taken a “ break ” , the researchers explained , a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain .	-4.2585
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine .	-2.9989
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.1647
The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.4823
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.7977
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction .	-3.4037
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-2.3650
“ They know that when they start smoking again , they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to remove the habit , ” he explains .	-5.4234
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.6943
Tripodi disputes having been influenced by Obeid	-2.3879
Former Laboratory Secretary Joe Tripodi from New South Wales has launched an investigation by state corruption supervision .	-5.0305
The former NSW minister denies having amended the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who owned hidden holdings in three plots in state-controlled land .	-5.5951
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption ) has expanded its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers to extend leasing contracts at the Circular Quay , where Obeids operates two restaurants and a café without tendering after their expiry in August 2005 .	-5.0250
Now it is being investigated for the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid 's hidden interest in the land after Tripodis had announced earlier deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole accordingly on Thursday .	-6.3619
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the leasing contracts .	-3.2807
The guards were opposed to this and also wanted longer duration .	-5.9130
In 2009 , the leasing contracts for companies at the Circular Quay , which contributed $ 2.5 million annually to the Obeids , were extended without public tender .	-4.4076
Tripodi , who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , initially spoke out in favour of public tenders .	-3.6614
But he disputed having made the changes at Obeid ’ s request , who , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a reorganization of the government ’ s leasing arrangements . .	-5.5784
One of the ICAC ’ s telephone newsletters showed talks between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had changed to the port ministry after working in the Fisheries Authority under obedience .	-6.0786
“ Was the topic discussed in these telephone calls the drafting of commercial leasing arrangements ? ” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi .	-5.3408
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.4800
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-2.2729
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-1.6285
Israeli fighter aircraft are attacking targets in Syria , so official sources of battatt. are . .	-10.1350
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a target in Latakia , Syria , on Thursday night , a senior government worker confirmed Fox News .	-10.7867
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .	-3.1207
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.9745
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria .	-2.9051
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subject to “ authenticity test ” .	-2.4460
The government is considering a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures .	-3.7477
If the test were to be introduced , it would be used by a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to occupy unskilled jobs or as a back door to move family and friends to Australia .	-5.0326
Today , a government proposal for discussion was published after the former Laboratory MEPs , Maxine McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be regarded as an insult by Australia ’ s neighbor. .	-5.6035
“ Volume declarations such as foreigners are supposed to put themselves in the back – and , Australians first – are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she told the Australia India Institute today .	-6.5431
Historically , this said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region have an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.4153
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-4.4955
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who spent yesterday talking about smuggling in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes , while others are still being considered .	-13.3296
If the “ authenticity criterion ” is adopted , then someone who applies for a visa could be checked to see whether “ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally associated with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-5.5093
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally recruited hundreds .	-4.5980
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died from a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island .	-3.2570
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin since his father ’ s death on Wednesday , who was also on the boat .	-4.4939
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.4659
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland .	-3.0096
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England should be implemented at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .	-4.8964
Secretary of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together ” . .	-3.0467
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.8156
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between London and the West Midlands .	-2.6703
After phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.6039
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-2.6956
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-10.3039
This includes the possibility of a trip period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.7235
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.3876
We are moving ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits . HS.	-11.3858
Without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .	-3.0403
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.0473
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-1.8181
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” efforts to integrate Scotland into the HS2 network .	-3.5608
Brown said : “ The high-speed railway link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , while Scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for rapid rail connections across the UK . ”	-4.7125
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner to the British Government and to examine the options for high-speed rail connections in Scotland , which will provide benefits for all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.4789
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and adopting the next steps together .	-3.9371
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being .	-2.9175
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones on startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such equipment .	-4.8512
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read , watch , or play videos on their devices during critical flight stages , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.3341
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they may not read their e-books when starting and landing .	-4.4811
Australian companies are observing the decision , which US airlines have to do a great deal of work to implement , but have no immediate plans to change their rules .	-15.1760
The CASA Aviation Safety Agency also declared that the announcement would be looked at , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment still apply in critical flight stages in Australia .	-4.9086
“ CASA does not currently have any specific rules regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft , ” was announced .	-4.3423
The subject is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and that passengers comply with the safety instructions given by cabin personnel .	-5.1381
Virgin has already had talks with the CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and declares that it is open to change , but it should be initiated by the legislator .	-5.7078
“ We would welcome a review of the CASA ’ s approval of electronic equipment , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-5.0340
Qantas said that we will remain with the current rules until further notice .	-4.7041
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing , and we currently have no plans to change this , ” the company said .	-5.2426
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-2.0454
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-3.8226
The decision has different effects on US companies depending on the age of the fleet .	-3.8162
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio disturbances through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instruction .	-4.5602
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at any height , ” the FAA announced .	-4.1647
In rare cases , in bad sight , the crew will instruct passengers to disable the equipment during the landing .	-10.0719
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the fans over the seats when starting and landing .	-5.4558
Before Schalke , BVB trailers had travelled with light missiles to provide ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-6.1636
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences .	-2.1657
Before the Football Bundesliga ’ s Friday match against the VfB Stuttgart , the ultras reacted with a silence – first .	-4.9721
It was an unfamiliar , almost spectacular acoustic that offered the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park .	-5.3244
The guest fans were mostly listened to with their singings .	-5.1188
The Southern Tribune , on the other hand , where the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand , presented themselves in an exceptionally quiet way : no songs , no battle calls .	-6.3059
The podium of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the common fire , remained unoccupied .	-3.6314
And in the front of the gallery a large flag blew lonely with the letter " Stadium Ban section " .	-6.9697
Only as a goalkeeper , Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player entered the place , did short-term jubilation burn up .	-5.6360
When his team colleagues followed , there were loud vocals and blowing scarves - but far from everywhere .	-4.2097
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South gallery , nothing went wrong .	-4.3274
Norbert Dickel also listed the positive experiences of recent days - Derbysieg , Victory of Arsenal , Trainer Jürgen Klopp 's extension of the contract , did not care for celebration .	-5.3255
Only five minutes before the attack , the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension , which was almost tangible with hands , unleashed in a loud cry when thickness , as usual , asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-7.7125
As usual , the southern gallery was the turn - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was again as usual .	-6.6642
And , at the latest , when the loud invitation " Derbysier stands on " came with an attack from the South gallery , everything was as always .	-7.4107
The silence previously was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-3.0825
Just before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the co-traveled BVB trailers had fired light missiles into the spectator races and into the square - and almost goalkeepers met Roman Weidenfeller .	-6.0243
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.6030
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke received the tips of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives .	-14.5556
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement , " the BVB Boss announced at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening .	-3.3681
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited the ultras from choreographing the home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-3.5519
" I banned this , " he said .	-2.8593
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.1301
In addition , the Ultras have identified various possibilities for punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one .	-5.8799
Otherwise , according to Watzke , the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.5942
" This is going to be decisive , " assured Watzke .	-4.5436
We must look forward to the reactions in the South gallery .	-4.6031
Pfandhouses are booming in Singapore , as the middle class crisis has come to an end .	-2.7559
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden arm , a ring and a couple of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters .	-4.4123
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.0977
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars ( approximately 1,730 euros ) each month as an administrator and her husband also works , monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-5.0965
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is so great that ValueMax , where it has exchanged , has become the third depository house listed on the Singapore stock exchange this week .	-4.7008
The pledging of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 Singapore in the case of Jananani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-3.2728
Typically , Pfandhouses in Singapore demand an effective annual rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-3.9696
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that there is no need to verify creditworthiness or proof of income , which is why loans are faster than banks can .	-6.3190
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhouses , as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-4.2778
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose fiscal policies in advanced economies , families with lower and middle-income depository houses are seeking to compensate for the difference in the case of staggering economies .	-5.8800
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s growing household debt , mainly through rising mortgages , described as a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-3.3657
The Agency estimates that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-2.9375
Malaysia is at the top of the list , with 80 % of GDP , an increase of 60 % in 2008 .	-2.6683
Economists are also worried about Thailand ’ s high consumer debt , which has just emerged from a technical recession this week .	-3.7206
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a reduction in consumer demand .	-3.1806
“ In the end , this means that , given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.0803
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-4.1849
In Singapore , approximately 70 percent of the pledged objects are gold in the 200 deposits of the city state .	-4.2645

The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator , EasyMoney , has experienced 20 % customer growth in its branches in recent months .	-3.3132
Growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , the operator of the Bendemeer branch , and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-14.6596
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it earned this week in Singapore .	-4.0748
While some lenders have come to the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that Pfandhouses not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also did not directly raise debt .	-5.1963
“ Customers lend items they already own , and the liquidation of personal valuables does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-4.2699
The bond business is increasingly accepted as short-term , secured financing in society .	-4.6350
Nor are all the people who use pledges in financial difficulties .	-4.6613
Rich people from Singapore also come to the ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-3.2177
Customers from every social class come to us .	-3.3700
“ These include wealthy who lend something to a business or investment in the short term , or small businesses that need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow , ” Yeah says .	-4.8949

Bailout Package Over 325 million Australian Dollars for Tasmanic Health	-8.3780
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions linked to the $ 325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the federal government cannot waste the money .	-3.9274
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic illnesses and system constraints .	-4.2518
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-3.5013
“ The government has created an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state , ” explained Plibersek today .	-3.6942
The $ 325 million package comprises $ 31 million in emergency aid for electoral services .	-2.8490
Further 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to grey star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-4.6141
In addition , there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better care after staying in hospital , specialist medical training , mental health services and the introduction of an electronic recording system for health data in local hospitals .	-5.5695
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected clinical workers have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-4.2003
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government .	-2.7982
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional funds were spent .	-4.3995
A three-member commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.3356
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable path . ”	-3.9610
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.2385
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” said Wilkie .	-3.7209
According to the federal government , these electoral services will largely compensate for the recent cuts .	-3.2632
But the Federal opposition ’ s health spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pavement solution . ”	-3.5669
“ We are in a position today because the Laboratory Government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.4634
It is unacceptable that a state government is pulling almost half a billion dollars out of the system , plugging the Commonwealth into 300 million , and then pretending to be good news .	-5.3874
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-2.9607

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons , according to a surveillance group .	-3.0838
Syria destroyed major chemical weapons and poisonous gas munitions , declared the global chemical weapons surveillance group on Thursday , while severe clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored .	-5.1739
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began soon three years ago .	-3.4057
The announcement of the Organisation for the Ban on Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline on the day before the deadline .	-4.5080
1 November , which Damascus , based in The Hague , had set up to destroy or “ inoperable ” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities , including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition .	-4.9360
The completion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-9.4211
The destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.2451
However , Damascus must begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks .	-2.9224
According to assumptions , there are approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including senior gas and the nerve gas of Sarin .	-3.8267
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday , experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory , based in Britain , announced .	-4.9716
On Thursday , the group of activists following the number of deaths in Syria through a network of activists declared that 120.296 people had died .	-4.4065
61,067 of them are civilians , including 6,365 children .	-2.3952
On the government side , 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad ’ s army , 18,678 being pro-government fighters , and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-8.3415
Also among the dead were army soldiers deserted in 2,202 and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-3.0803
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.0805
This number has not been updated so far .	-1.8207
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country .	-2.0386
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of which have links with al-Qaeda groups .	-2.9588
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .	-3.0038
The struggles underline the danger faced by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arms arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-4.0692
According to the OPCW , which cooperates closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and experienced all the important production and filling facilities mentioned by Syria . ”	-4.5172
That is why “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-3.0497
Earlier this week , the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus .	-3.2132
Due to security concerns , the inspectors said that it was not possible to visit two institutions .	-3.7725
On Thursday , OPWC declared that , according to Syria ’ s statement , the two locations had “ been abandoned ... and the chemical weapons program ’ s objects there had been relocated to other so-called institutions that were inspected . ” . . . . , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.3428
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.6742
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved by the OPWC 's executive committee next month .	-8.0377
“ I prefer the hat of the bravery and the courage you all showed in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Supervisory Organization , in a comment published by OPCW .	-5.2044
For three years now , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting Assad ’ s government and its security forces , which include many Alawites , a secession of Shia Islam .	-4.8600
With regard to further developments , the head of the observation group , Rami Abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-3.4430
The cause of the explosion was not known , he explained .	-2.0263
Rage over Bali Bombers	-3.3569
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the bombing in Bali in 2002 reacted with anger at the judgment of the last of the instigators who were tried , because they believe that Umar Patek should be shot by law .	-5.6780
Patek , who spent almost ten years fleeing as one of the most sought-after people in Southeast Asia , was sentenced to a prison sentence of 20 years yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing .	-5.2239
He could be released after 15 years by sentencing him .	-4.2755
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-4.2122
There was also a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .	-3.8897
The Public Prosecutor had called for a lifelong prison sentence , even though it could have applied for the death penalty for the man , who is also called “ Demolition Man ” because of his reputation as a master bomber .	-5.0711
The decision aroused painful memories of June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago .	-3.5625
Fighting with tears , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.4055
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-2.0396
“ You should put him before a shooting command , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-4.5836
I have to live every day with no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters .	-4.0805
The Sari Club was aligned to the ground when , on 12 October 2002 , a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 23 o 'clock .	-6.1252
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives .	-2.7770
He fell into coma for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times as he was in a life-conservation system .	-4.9086
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.6555
In fact , this type should have the death penalty before everyone else .	-3.9435
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-2.8756
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much .	-2.4583
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers in court .	-2.4709
He escaped almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later .	-4.0936
During the negotiation , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.5507
“ He did not face up , ” said Corteen .	-2.3846
Until recently , he has shown no regret for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-3.7449
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which will be commemorated in Bali and Australia .	-3.9241
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.6754
Patek may still appeal against his judgment .	-2.1863
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not conduct mobile calls )	-2.8177
Air passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , music , and watching movies , from departure to landing , but not use the mobile phone , according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the United States .	-6.4097
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.4569
How quickly they would be implemented depending on the airline , FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference .	-4.2895
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the aircraft personnel as well as the rules for damaging the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .	-5.3762
The FAA declared that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.4939
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue .	-1.8839
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-3.8361
Currently , passengers must switch off smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed . . are . .	-3.9985
You may not start them again until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-4.0486
When entering the landing flight , passengers must switch off them again and not start them again before the aircraft has landed .	-5.7864
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at the start , landing and rolling field , the FAA declared .	-4.8474
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to larger heights to use Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-4.2647
Laura Glading , President of the professional association of professional flight attendants , welcomed the changes .	-2.6094
“ If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” Glading commented .	-3.7809
Frankly , we are sorry to have to feel like watchdogs on this issue .	-3.7990
Nevertheless , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging e-mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained banned , the authority explained .	-4.1067
Passengers are asked to move smartphones , tablets and other equipment into flight mode .	-3.1766
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble similar online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines in public , refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked at the gate .	-5.4294
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stowed , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-9.6192
Mobile calls during the flight will also remain prohibited .	-3.3748
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA , is responsible for regulating telephone calls .	-3.0935
FAA may lift prohibition on certain electronic devices when starting and landing .	-3.6759
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board , national transport security expert on CBS News , said that mobile phones are still considered a risk .	-4.1652
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disruptions in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disturb transmitters , ” says Rosenker .	-5.1569
Last month , a consultative committee of the industry , set up by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.8591
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-9.3633
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri take the view that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban .	-3.2403
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to impose because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .	-3.6315
Some studies mention this , which forgets or ignores the dismantling of the device by up to a third of passeng.	-4.9059
In 1966 , the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disruptions in navigation and communication equipment by passenger carrying UKW radios , which were then the latest technology trend .	-6.6981
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not represent electronic interferences .	-4.0784
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for several years now when the flight height is reached .	-4.9957
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interferences .	-2.9248
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment according to the new directives , Huerta said .	-2.7636
Today ’ s electronic devices generally produce much less radio radiation than previous generations .	-3.8308
E-readers , for example , only emit minimal radiation when you browse .	-4.7949
However , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-8.3499
Amazon.com. Amazon.com.	-2.7630
In 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect them .	-4.5392
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.5713
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believes that the disruption of the equipment is true , even if the risk is minimal .	-4.3668
Other committee members have said that there are only a few reports of pilots who are in favour of disrupting aircraft systems through the equipment , most of which are very old .	-5.8659
The committee , however , recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange passenger disengagement in case of instrument landing under poor visibility .	-5.6132
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers , who would now be fully equipped with technology .	-5.6343
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.8962
Vogel saved by air rescue service from North Sea Bohrinsel released again	-4.4005
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island , was released again into nature .	-4.4667
Last month , the water rall was flew to Aberdeen by a helicopter , where it was plugged by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa .	-5.6009
Colin Seddon , head of the centre , said : “ This waterrall was probably a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe , stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-4.4805
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-3.1045
He added : “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.5244
When the water rally was released , it was fit and healthy again .	-4.3990
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.7429
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those in Britain who care for prosperity and work want to change in our relations with the EU .	-4.2156
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll among British business leaders , asking them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.3473
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 executives from the economy , representing around the UK ’ s corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.3108
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.3224
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing , while the states in the EU are stagnant .	-4.0446
They want to see new trading links from government to countries like China , India , and Brazil , rather than stopping the long and hard process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-5.3845
In their view , on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – most business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be returned to Westminster .	-4.9327
There was general discontent about the single market , because , according to companies , the cost of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed that they are traditionally the most pro-European .	-5.4456
Finally , and this probably says the most , our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .	-6.4698
This insight , found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the booklet of action back to Britain .	-5.2716
Much is at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum .	-4.3998
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating British conditions for EU membership .	-3.0469
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of power back to Britain .	-3.4625
A better deal for the British economy is possible , and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.8622
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , which means increased attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-4.4914
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new Gazera era .	-3.6314
The start of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects , declared by the Gazprom Executive Board .	-3.5463
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said the CEO of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.5511
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-2.0967
South Stream is supposed to provide more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes across Europe .	-3.7488
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , will increase the risk of conventional routes , as is official .	-4.9954
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ forever . ”	-2.5498
Bulgarian consumers receive South Stream gas at discounted rates when the entire project starts in 2015 .	-3.6760
According to Gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries should start on the planned route at the end of the year .	-3.3412
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-2.0154

Germany ’ s real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the country ’ s comparatively good economic environment .	-4.6271
This is what Christian Ulbrich , CEO of Europe , the Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle pointed out on the 9th day of the Börsen newspaper ’ s real estate .	-4.2631
How German commercial properties are sought shows the transaction volume , according to Ulbrich .	-5.3969
In the first three quarters of this year , it increased by 31 % compared to the previous year 's average .	-3.4130
In Britain , the plus was only 6 % , in France 19 % .	-3.0961
" Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate , " Ulbrich said .	-2.4365

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused Jonathan Lord of sexual offences	-10.4525
Two YMCA workers from New South Wales ( NSW ) were charged with sexual crimes involving children before accusations were made in 2011 against the child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for the sexual abuse of children .	-5.3609
But in the opening declaration before the Commission , the YMCA declared that “ there has never been an incident of sexual child abuse in the organisation . ”	-5.1953
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography crimes and another in which a sporting teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was sentenced in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him . in .	-6.2647
Hare said Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-3.3733
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening declaration to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that “ there have been external YMCA checks recognizing the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety . ”	-5.6006
Instead , evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-3.7992
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the management failed “ from me to the bottom ” in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report infringements of the children ’ s safety guidelines .	-6.1060
Lord was sentenced at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA .	-4.2159
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.5553
However , Hare disputed that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s infringements of children ’ s safety .	-5.2498
The staff said that they had observed violations , including that Lord was alone with children , cared for them privately as a baby sitter , let them sit on his lap , said one that he loved it , and let children play with his mobile phone .	-7.0055
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the Child Service Leader Jacqui Barnat , who was Lords superior in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time very unnearby . ”	-6.1989
The Managing Director declared that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to reimburse their superior noti.	-4.6613
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment , which is why they had not reported him .	-4.0496
Hare declared that he told the Board of Management of the YMCA NSW that the lesson to draw the organization from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” does not affect the notification by employees , and the Board agreed to it .	-5.6504
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy commitments shortly after the accusations occur had been taken by the Managing Director of the Child Services of YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-4.5287
He said that this should prevent contamination of evidence , but that was “ overzealous ” and badly implemented .	-3.5514
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , explained to the Commission Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , an expert on sexual child abuse .	-4.2049
He explained that there have been “ serious problems ” in recruiting , reviewing , recruiting , training and supervising employees .	-4.5454
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.9265
Tony Blair declared that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that comeback is unlikely . .	-4.5131
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.2526
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade of Head of State , Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics , and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East .	-4.7409
On the question of whether he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London : “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-4.4834
When the Horse Show experts arrived in Cardiff to mark the horse of the year , they realized that a hard competition was imminent .	-5.5206
But nobody was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.6510
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago , and his Shetland-Pony Toffee poured loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents .	-5.5007
The inseparable couple , both equally large , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style at the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-3.7721
During his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had put his plate hat in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring .	-6.1352
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony , which was well above his age .	-3.6106
And Toffee received best notes for his performance and personality .	-3.2690
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practised the Shetland Pony every day .	-3.9438
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great tendency . ”	-2.5984
They had to compete against the entire participant field and went out with gold pokal and rosette .	-5.5998
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.3360
Fully strangers in the arena thought it so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-3.9156
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell , who has been showing horses for over ten years .	-3.0930
Howells told : “ The whole audience was electrified and everyone fired and claimed it . ”	-5.3538
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and , although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-3.2436
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to care for .	-3.0888
As it has started , it will not take long for it to be on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I am sure it will perform well .	-4.7762
A spokesman of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.1232
Together they are a great team .	-1.1130
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring .	-10.4672
They care for good collaboration between Pony and Leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-11.3278
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothing has played its part in making it really perfect for the occasion .	-4.6379
Chinese newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after appeal .	-2.9427
A Chinese newspaper calling on the front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-4.2248
The Guangzhou based New Express printed a rare public appeal to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.8429
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a part-state firm .	-4.3476
Now , the New Express is subject to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-9.6471
The “ Rectification Order ” came from the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-2.7985
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-3.1914
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly , ” the regulator announced in a statement .	-2.8942
She said that she had decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporting license . ”	-3.9862
Moreover , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to complete rectification of the New Express and recommended identifying the relevant leaders at the New Express and immediately reviewing the New Express management team . ”	-5.5206
Chen wrote several articles for the New Express , reporting on alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion .	-10.0581
After being arrested , the newspaper issued two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-3.8244
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment .	-3.5911
“ In this case , I damaged Zoomlion , as did the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he said to the state news channel CCTV .	-4.2228
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-2.5466
I realised that I was wrong .	-3.1861
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page and stated that it failed to check the reports correctly .	-4.5098
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television .	-7.1410
Experts say that confessions are still routinely imposed , despite a legislative amendment at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to accuse themselves .	-4.1499
Drug tunnels with their own railways between the US and Mexico discovered	-3.8387
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric rail , has now been discovered .	-3.4646
The US authorities described the 120 centimetre tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found .	-3.0285
The tunnel , which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of nearly six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-5.8385
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs .	-3.3968
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized , the authorities declared .	-3.6039
In the discovery of the tunnel eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured , according to the records of the court .	-3.5367
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were accused of owning and selling marijuana and cocaine .	-2.7917
They face prison sentences between ten years and lifelong when they are guilty .	-4.6570
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .	-2.3084
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-2.2365
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers .	-4.2469
In 2010 , authorities found a passage of almost 640 metres long with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storage houses in San Diego .	-4.8045
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves .	-1.5233
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.1229
However , in an interview Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves .	-8.3241
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year flynn .	-1.6227
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about the separation from his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.6638
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which should be broadcasted on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or hope it " .	-4.0149
Kerr and he still loved himself , emphasized the 36-year-old .	-3.0389
" We will support each other and love Flynn as a parent " .	-9.6906
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , in 2011 their sons Flynn was born .	-2.3445
Veganism , according to lexicas , is subject to vegetarianism , but it differs considerably from that .	-5.5093
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream torts , ice cream or a powerful edamer , they are not on a vegan 's menu .	-5.5354
Milk , cheese , egg , besides the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan leaves away from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied .	-4.5913
What remains , you may wonder , but when you look at it , the vegan diet is characterized by a considerable ingenuity .	-5.7104
" Bread slashes are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reformist house , who provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.5930
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse .	-2.4659
For 13 years , the native New Zealand has lived vegan , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian . . " " " " " , " " " " " " " " " " "	-9.7128
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became a vegan .	-2.5953
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the choice of shoes , " says Proctor , who prefers art leather to normal leather .	-5.1207
He recognized that other everyday issues do not involve animal products .	-3.6961
First and foremost , vegan is his ethics .	-2.2549
" I do not want animals to die for me , " Proctor says the vegan 's maxim , which covers all consumption behaviour .	-4.8425
Instead of mourning burgers , stirrers or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered completely new products and increased enthusiasm .	-3.9809
" It 's a double bonus , " Proctor says today , " in fact , vegan is not a renunciation , it 's an enrichment , but an enrichment " .	-6.1724
And it was precisely these conditions that led some even so well-intentioned attempts to fail .	-5.5269
" The addiction factor is a decisive factor that lets many quickly abandon , similar to smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-4.4282
And applies : " Certain tastes are not to be fixed on the animal " .	-5.5279
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.7335
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " explains the vegan .	-3.7150
For example , Proctor brings Aubergines , Champignons and a few vegan dresses to a barbecue festival .	-4.6087
He takes care of a balanced , varied diet , where it should taste very often .	-6.7819
Of course you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-3.2092
" It should taste , but this is not only to reduce animal food , " says Proctor .	-3.8633
He has not suffered health damage , including eating disorders , another widespread assumption .	-4.3925
For me , the conversion had a positive aspect .	-3.1598
I do not absorb any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share .	-4.4491
There are high-performance athletes who only feed vegan .	-2.5570
" My blood values are excellent , I am often checked " , Proctor betrays .	-4.8995
In particular , the lack of vitamin B12 warns many veganism critics .	-2.8644
" Because animals are fed with feedingstuffs , rather than grazing on pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat that you buy in the cooling chest , the vitamin B12 percentage is high , " Proctor finds .	-11.1290
For vegans , it is also possible to take coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.5358
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-2.0449
Far routes do not have to go to Proctor for food procurement .	-4.2361
There are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soymilk and other products .	-3.8507
I find everything I need on the spot .	-2.7016
Only from time to time I buy something special .	-2.2420
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but this is the way in which " ordinary " finished products are known to be " .	-4.8978
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed .	-3.8763
" There is a lot to discover in the house kitchen , with a few small tricks you can achieve good , if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-5.3008
Margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with his vegan cheese cake Proctor could also bring his parents to the surprise .	-5.0633
Family festivals give the vegan a new spice .	-2.6766
This is dynamic when cooking together , which is a new priority .	-5.2213
" The situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-3.4928
Of course , he has already been sceptical .	-3.3344
Do you not taste my food anymore ?	-10.4773
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - if you have such questions , you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip .	-5.5145
" I do not reject people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be enclaved .	-4.5896
And , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem as vegan alien as expected - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed .	-6.5546
Also Fast Food is allowed .	-1.7751
Pommes are available everywhere !	-2.1411
" Many döner shops offer falafel , or a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-2.8363
In a pizzeria , he evaporates on pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .	-12.5259
The restaurants are so slowly adjusting to this .	-3.7078
" When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult " , the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people , make them aware of it " .	-10.2677
" If there is enough demand , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , " he hopes .	-3.6390
Vegane restaurants are developing , such as the combo buses in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei .	-3.8067
Proctor wishes that other restaurants have at least a vegan meal on the menu .	-3.2164
Basically , vegan dishes are available for everyone .	-2.4478
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.1789
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " Proctor notes .	-3.7051
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part impossible from the outset , " says Proctor .	-3.8359
However , purchasing vegan products can be difficult at the beginning .	-12.6916
Especially when one learns to understand that animal additives can also contain in earth nuts as colourers , one seems to be quickly leaving courage to follow ethics in so many hurdles and traps .	-6.9391
Not only for this reason , Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are supplied with food and also cleaning agents .	-3.9952
" Sometimes you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to , " It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble , " Proctor knows .	-5.4266
Veganism , it is an important moral signal that raises awareness .	-3.3977
Perhaps he does not quite manage to abandon his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically .	-4.5963
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath .	-3.2864
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon of German time .	-2.4909
In a communication the operator was responsible for technical problems .	-2.7364
The other eleven US option markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.3950
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns with the stock exchange operator .	-3.7183
Only on Tuesday had the Nasdaq indices not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport .	-3.7145
In August this year alone , there were two breakdowns in one week .	-3.8019
First , the US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent massively flawed purchasing orders to the option markets due to technical problems .	-3.4988
As a result , stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and cancel the orders .	-6.3425
Two days later , half of the total US stock trading came to a halt for several hours due to a computer panel on the Nasdaq Exchange .	-4.5305
Last year , the Facebook Stock Exchange was also a cause of concern .	-6.3622
The Nasdaq systems were unable to cope with the flood of purchasing and sales orders , later identified the SEC Exchange Supervisory Board , and thundered the company to a record $ 10 million penalty .	-6.3903
Konstanz : Cyclists are 63 years old .	-10.9191
The accident had occurred according to the police when a 26 year old man on Thursday evening , around 10 p.m. , travelled with a women 's bicycle in a ruthless way from the railway station to the market place on the left .	-7.8059
When a 63 year old man suddenly walked from a club , the bicycle driver , according to the police , was unable to stop in time .	-7.3773
In the following collision , the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house , went to the ground and moved on to the head a 15-centimetre long square wound .	-7.6994
A rescue team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment .	-2.4954
British police are sending Assange an extradition notice .	-4.5128
The British police have today handed over a delivery notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who has sought refuge and requested asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-4.3902
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian was given a “ call to face ” calling on him to appear in a police guard , and added , if he failed to do so , he threatened to arrest him .	-5.9015
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden for charges of a sexual offence , after exploiting its possibilities under British law , since the Supreme Court rejected its objection to extradition earlier this month .	-5.1750
As he fears that Stockholm will hand him over to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.9957
Scotland Yard “ sent a call to a 40-year-old man to sit at a police guard at a time we chose , ” said a speaker .	-5.6772
He continues to violate the terms of his release on deposit .	-2.1717
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call .	-2.9757
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible spy accusations after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks revelation website .	-4.4602
The driver , who was straight between the legs at 210 km / h and hot drink , gets $ 1,000 penalty .	-5.2996
A driver was imposed a penalty of $ 1,000 because he had driven between his legs with up to 210 km / h and a hot drink .	-4.9574
Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree .	-2.8447
After the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage cup between his legs .	-2.6776
Howie confessed guilty to the Colchester court without the necessary care and attention .	-4.9005
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban .	-1.8170
Howie has also been sentenced to pay $ 90 and a $ 100 victim surcharge .	-3.8320
Tax for foreign property owners against London ’ s speculative bubble	-2.4102
The Treasury has temporarily calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who imposed a 7 % stamp tax in the 2012 budget on homes that cost more than <unk> 2 million and annual fees for buyers who hold homes as firms and not individuals .	-5.3904
Already , revenue from the stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts exceeded <unk> 708 million in the 2012 / 13 fiscal year , collecting proceeds for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North-East , North-West , Yorkshire , and the Humber region .	-4.9776
Cook said : “ Following the increases in stamp taxes on high-cost housing and the introduction of associated legislation against bypassing , it is hard to claim that high-quality properties are taxed too low , regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system . ”	-6.5588
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about purchasing real estate in London , or prevent owners from selling it , ” he added .	-4.4982
First class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy south-west belt of London , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , has increased by a record 11.8 % last year .	-5.1258
The prices in Central London have a uniform 5.6 % annual growth , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” where the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such as an investigation by Savill .	-5.4550
Scientists were able to throw more light on the connection between a dog 's tail turning and his mood .	-5.0902
Previous research showed that happy dogs with the tail moved more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) while the left side was nervous dogs .	-14.3240
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences .	-2.4476
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ People are well aware that the left and right brain half respond differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.9921
Here we tried to look at this with other species .	-3.1815
He also noticed that in dogs , just like in humans , the right brain half is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions .	-5.9877
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side tail of their species , researchers monitored the animals while these films saw other dogs .	-6.0168
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior .	-2.2015
Probably we will soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction , sometimes in the other direction . a . . a . . . . . and . . . .	-14.3862
Professor Vallorigara said : “ We showed dogs movies with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we were able to control the movement of the tail more left or right . ”	-4.7062
When the animals saw a dog moving the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the turning dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.0008
But when the tail propensity was mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog that wastes ) , their heart rate rose and they looked troublesome .	-5.9115
According to Professor Vallorigara , dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-2.9010
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience of which movements they should worry about and when not .	-4.8414
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and if you are linked to the tail in one direction with friendly behavior , and if the right side produces a less friendly behavior , you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.7977
The researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could provide a better understanding of the emotions of their animal .	-10.3847
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog preservation and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Hospital at the University of Bristol , declared that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs .	-5.3428
Last year , a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .	-4.1529
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ Dogs go to a robot dog when their tail turns left rather than being troubled – exactly the other way than in the Italian study . ”	-5.8546
According to his statement , the differences could therefore be that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs . . . . , . . , , , , , , , ,	-11.3397
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.2283
“ Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for various purposes , many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-4.2044
However , since their behavior can be recorded simply , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-14.1445
Arctic Monkeys moves appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner 's disease .	-3.2092
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer is infected with throat inflammation .	-5.2178
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday .	-2.7161
Due to the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner , however , the concert must now be moved .	-3.9563
The band ’ s announcement came after having had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-3.5695
In an explanation on their official website , Arctic Monkeys announced : “ After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight , and at medical advice , Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday , November 1 . ”	-9.0360
“ At Alex Turner , there has been a diagnosis of cold-headed inflammation , which is why he is un. ”	-5.8853
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November , which was moved to 21 November at the Hydro in Glasgow .	-3.9196

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February .	-1.7272
Pope Francis will be appointed for the first time on 22 February new cardinals of the Catholic Church , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-2.7996
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.1765
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.1737
However , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-3.8028
In a statement announcing the news , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held for the appointment of the new cardinals , also known as a consistorium .	-4.8758
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistorium in February , so that other meetings that require cardinals from all over the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-4.2810
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably have fallen by February .	-2.6821
He declared that a pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary to ensure that the number of cardinals entitled to vote is 120 again , and as many cardinals as 80 as he wants .	-4.8396
The consistorium next year is important because it is the first since Francis ’ election in March of this year , Valero said .	-4.8771
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and particularly Italy .	-3.2402
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.1296
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-1.9397
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the creation of the Cardinal Council , founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways of reforming the church .	-8.9286
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.9875
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.3748
He declared that it was “ well possible ” that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice .	-4.0480

GM is calling back new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seat rest .	-3.2613
General Motors call back nearly 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks , built in 2014 , to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , such as a Friday Communication from the US Regulatory Authority for Vehicle Security .	-5.7080
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seat rest .	-4.5023
For this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety in the case of headrestraints .	-3.7807
“ If the vehicle is driven from behind , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the passengers , so there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-5.3596
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.7470
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-4.3381
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October .	-2.4893
Due to the 16-day government shutdown , NHTSA could not check the notification letter , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-4.4543
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra Trucks , which were newly developed for the 2014 model year , increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , GM declared on Friday .	-4.1882

Obama voter ’ s desperate cry	-2.3215
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-2.1316
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics .	-3.8850
The blockade policy does not apologize for the website problems of Obamacare , the drone attacks .	-3.5072
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what would have been possible .	-2.3091
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-2.1836
I am reading a terribly sad book .	-1.8899
It is a book that I believed would raise my mind during the muddy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again .	-5.7935
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” ( courage to win ) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .	-8.0252
When I finish with my patient offices and go to bed in the evening , the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take a breath for a speech .	-6.2701
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesmen held to reflect the historic importance of this hour .	-4.0583
My classmates cry with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-3.2122
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.0274
When Obama moved to office in 2008 , he had approval values of 82 % .	-2.8380
And then I close the book .	-0.9946
To switch back to the present is a evil awakening as if one is torn out of a dream .	-3.7584
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-6.7173
In the years since I first voted , something has actually changed .	-2.9214
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.3317
I acknowledge the great and versatile things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.4124
I agree that party political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.7279
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end of my explanatory attempts .	-4.2194
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.0868
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows foreign leaders to intercept or kill innocent children by drones overseas .	-3.7057
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans ’ private lives , and why whistleblowers are punished to disclose state misconduct .	-3.8744
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , a US citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public financing and spending limits are being bypassed during the presidential elections .	-3.3421
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.1821
And , recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.5462
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected .	-1.8684
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could have contradicted its previous political campaigns .	-4.1112
Obviously , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-4.2121
But if I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-2.8883
And that bothers me most .	-2.0141
I elected Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.2436
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unbalanced alternative , he seemed unable to define his direction and positions .	-3.9950
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard for so long .	-3.7689
But with Obama ’ s assent ratings down to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become all the harder .	-4.6284
It awakens in me the yearning for the many promises that have dissolved into the air .	-4.0116
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to plug a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary elections .	-4.0520

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave	-2.1258
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters would become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .	-10.1526
The mining magnate , which is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon taxes , made the claim when he wanted to wipe out questions about whether he was in conflict .	-6.7464
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether CO2 and mining taxes are being cut or cut .	-3.4959
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.4601
“ He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she is given a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-4.6655
Two months after the election , the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes .	-3.5265
Palmer called for a revision of the process to count votes , so that they can move faster .	-5.6649
Tony Abbott ’ s daughters Frances and Bridget .	-1.2465
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.5308
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-1.0473
Why should we not have a system where you invade , enter the data into a computer , choose immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-5.4079
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .	-2.5699
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don 't like them ?	-4.2723
It is incredible to vote with pencils today .	-3.5270
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election , and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-9.5194
Palmer , 59 , declared that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new post “ very seriously . ”	-3.2704

RBS suspends two Forex Traders	-1.3918
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , so two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the global authorities ’ investigation of alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly on track .	-5.6035
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in investigating the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion of owners change daily .	-4.0592
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the expanding investigation resulting from the Libor interbank scandal .	-4.2353
The Bank , which did not comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities .	-2.7052
“ Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-3.3912
Last month , people close to the situation stated that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-9.1608
This trader , Richard Usher , had left the RBS 2010 and is now to have been judged by his current position as European leader of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan .	-4.7175
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading near Citi , was judged this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly the leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-4.0700
None of these traders has been accused of any misconduct .	-2.5635
Bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup belonged to the Instant Message Group of Usher , said people close to the situation .	-3.8114
UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had declared that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks .	-4.4128
At least six global authorities – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority , Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers are supposed to have agreed on transactions in the currency market .	-4.1056
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .	-3.1678
Banks comb instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-3.5015
The news about these studies has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks ’ trading units in recent years , but this year has been under pressure because low currency volatility limits speculators ’ chances .	-5.6013
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-4.0590
A leading trader noticed that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks means that “ you can influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-5.6186
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she cancelled a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he had caused a loss of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.4835
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-2.3898
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” Credit Suisse said .	-3.6936
The construction fence on the Bechtle plot painted .	-3.7384
A group of citizens ' initiative " Swiss meadow " has embellished the fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.1800
In addition , she cleaned up and broadened the footpath , as stated in a press release .	-4.6630
The planned covering of the decommissioned house in the rear of the plot was not allowed for security reasons , because the site threatens to slide down .	-5.8350
Alfred Abel , who is currently managing the plot , had agreed to embellish the plot with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .	-4.4419
Before the BI ’ s action , a banner with the message “ We were in favour ” was placed .	-6.0903
However , this did little to disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative in their action .	-12.7632
Their motto on the big poster was " We are against ruins " .	-3.6729
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail .	-4.8484
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the " construction site " it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many , even though not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-5.6468
But they start to resign , because the city continues to delay these responses , it is said by the BI .	-4.0177
As we have heard , the public statements of the mayor also have an impact .	-3.9327
In May , at the municipal council meeting , he said that he feared the end of the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the decision of the citizen .	-6.9965
Some seem to be scared , others feel that they are a " plump attempt to blackmail " on the population , as stated in the BI press release .	-8.2373
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .	-2.7307
Rangnick Schelte für Schiris : Mane keine Schwalbenkönig nicht Schwalbenkönig .	-3.7250
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current high shape of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg is , so disappointed the sport director of the " Bullen " showed himself by the referees .	-4.9390
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Schwalbenkönige " , he defended the two offensive wizards at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .	-4.1985
The latest occasion for Rangnick 's criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3 : 0 against Val Gardena last Sunday , in which the Senegalese became a supposed actress - which was not , of course , as the TV pictures showed .	-6.2182
" A gross mistake , " Rangnick said , which arbitrator Harkam called " completely overwhelmed " .	-5.1183
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-2.6977
He defended his German compatriot decisively : " I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation .	-4.7853
Schmidt himself wants no contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with his hut .	-4.1203
I do not know why .	-1.0394
" For I am the one who was insulted , " emphasized the 46 year-old .	-9.0859
However , in view of the success story , Rangnick agreed on a praise .	-5.2156
" There are only two words for this : good , " he said .	-3.9648
There is not much to expose .	-10.9336
Especially the way the team plays is impressive .	-2.3273
This should continue .	-4.2801
Changes in cadres during the winter transfer period will not be possible .	-4.4437
There are no great reasons to change something .	-1.9230

Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-1.6465
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-2.7383
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority .	-3.8422
The chief judge , John Roberts , beat the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy decided against it .	-3.9886
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and also took the view that the provision of the Health Act that states would either have to extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid subsidies is not unconstitutional .	-6.8501
The proceedings against the law had been tried by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-3.0017
The law was firmly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney , in the 2012 primary campaign .	-9.0288
Norway : Norwegian place makes light with giant mirrors	-3.1227
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light to their dark valley .	-3.3201
Due to the low degree of sun , the Rjukan , located in the Vestfjord valley , usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-4.5472
With three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 metres , on Wednesday a century drew true .	-3.9752
" Finally ! " , mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the launch ceremony in the channel TV2 .	-4.5617
Some valley inhabitants were right to sunchairs , others set up sunglasses for safety .	-6.6505
Until now , sun-hungry people had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter .	-5.0972
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented a proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley .	-3.6185
This basic idea existed since 1913 .	-3.5760
After several years of debate , the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns ( approximately 615 000 euros ) expensive project .	-3.9091
A similar construction has given the Italian Alpine resort Viganella wintry sunshine for several years .	-4.4861
Post hardly empty on Sundays or Sundays	-4.2199
" Many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red points for the Sunday emptying are still at various mailboxes in the core city and the districts , but reading the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG , you quickly find that the emptying is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays , " says the FDP .	-7.1354
A request from the FDP confirmed this .	-2.3877
On Sundays and holidays , only before the post office building is emptied in the Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and in the Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-3.8444
Whether or not Hofheim and Rosengarten will be emptied Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP ’ s question .	-9.6562
The social and youth spokesman of the FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to hook up here .	-4.0692
Sunday emptying is an important postal service especially for appointments .	-4.4767
" This enterprise is radically and unreasonably thinning , despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013 . "	-4.3809
Thomas Bittner , the Liberal Group and City Association chairman , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that the emptiness periods are being changed or deleted in secret ' .	-6.3360
The postal service is miles away from the proximity to the .	-4.6930
" At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays , " says Bittner and Tube unisono .	-4.9026
Also for the core city , it would have to be possible to reach a mailbox with an empty Sunday on foot .	-7.3170
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans to discuss this matter with the post office .	-5.4313
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.7221
His knowledge , however , also exists in Hofheim a Sunday empty .	-4.6175
Your party has , of course , advocated privatisation .	-4.1309
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " said Maier .	-1.7197
Frankfurt parking fees should increase sharply .	-3.1693
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.1676
This morning , the city 's magistrate advises on a presentation of traffic decorators Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-5.3704
Parking fees are therefore to be increased by 50 % .	-3.6019
However , the price should not be increased , but the time interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes .	-5.3077
In December , the City Assembly will have to decide .	-3.9675
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt believes that this is not a good idea .	-3.7104
The parking facility directly in front of the shop is " a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers " .	-5.7599
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is ' reasonable and actually long overdue ' .	-3.2078
Public transport also becomes more expensive .	-2.0592
Freudenstadt : Rapid actions are rushing hosts . .	-6.8144
With a narrow cadre , the Messen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb . . .	-10.2457
The elves stood with an experienced team on the other side of the network .	-4.2526
Soon , however , it became apparent that , even as a result of the age , they were not entirely able to compete with the rapid actions of the delightful cities .	-7.6875
Gönningers did a very difficult job with the hard and placed surcharges .	-7.5258
Repeatedly , they missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz played over the network center and were not there to defend the block .	-6.1790
Two high first sentence profits clearly expressed the superiority of the delightful cities in all matters .	-4.1330
Given this crushing and playing performance , the third sentence was then slightly lax and lustless to the 3 : 0 final ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-5.3406
On November 2nd , with the TV Baiersbronn , which could clearly prevail in Nagold , a much more powerful opponent will be in the field .	-5.9114
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-1.5691
In the B-Class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-4.0135
They delivered a highly competitive two-hour match .	-2.4117
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and points in the ball acceptance ; even in the passports , precision was sometimes deficient and in some critical gaming scenes , the overzeal prevented the view of possible point profits .	-8.4516
In this highly balanced meeting , however , the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto agreed on the great physical commitment and a pleasant commitment of both teams .	-5.6900
Care day at the small English-style hut	-3.1799
A group of dedicated participants met at the small England hut in Ibach for the fifth day of care in the succession of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald .	-4.8562
Due to suggestions from the population , the view into the valley should be cut this day in the area of the hut , Mayor Helmut Kaiser said .	-4.8142
Many hikers , according to Emperor , described this area as the splendor of the gorge , where the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views .	-5.5530
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the nursing day was a suitable tool for strengthening the connection between man and nature .	-4.9813
It gives every citizen the opportunity to emphasise in nature itself .	-4.7541
Ecological consideration can also be taken into account with the tourist aspect .	-3.9361
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Natural Protection of the Freiburg Regional Council following the welcome of Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a .	-6.2216
According to Tribukait , the tourist objective of the foresight is to maintain the old Allmendweidfeld , which has grown rapidly , with its specific protected habitat types , by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures .	-6.4405
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass hoppers , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.8670
You need these free connections to Arterkeeping .	-4.2817
Tribukait said that at this point she does not want to miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-4.0631
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning .	-3.2635
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to what has been achieved with the Life Project and previous nursing days for the future .	-6.1835
According to these various statements , Resident Manager Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the assistants into groups .	-5.2425
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance , the forest trailer may be ready to call up . .	-5.2169
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone belt .	-4.3002
The aim was to have a free view at the viewpoint .	-3.7052
Löffingen : Köpfler still only candidate	-3.9926
Information on the Internet : Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school- , children 's , youth and senior citizens policy , as well as its own urban plants can be described as an attractive city , no second mayor candidate has yet signed up .	-6.4598
The only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger , who is no longer a candidate for reasons of age , is the 46-year-old banking businessman and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen .	-4.9342

Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Nortel patents	-1.3377
On Thursday , the group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents tightened an avalanche of claims for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was outbid by him in the insolvency auction of Nortel .	-5.5837
Rockstar , the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringements in the US District Court in Texas .	-2.8340
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-1.6167
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.5442
The patents relate to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , so the lawsuit that hits the core of Google 's search engine business .	-4.9985
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly attainable .	-9.1702
Samsung , Huawei , and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple ’ s and Microsoft ’ s mobile products . and . are .	-5.4057
In 2011 , Google issued an initial bid of more than $ 900 million for Nortel patents .	-2.3138
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.7295
After being outbid by Rockstar ’ s Nortel patents , Google Motorola Mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola ’ s library in patents .	-4.4239
“ Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the lawsuit patent at the auction , Google has violated and continues to do so , ” says the letter of complaint .	-5.4951
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google because it claims that Google 's patent infringement is intentional , according to the accusation .	-4.2033
Egypt ’ s First Free Elected Presidents	-2.2466
Mohammed Morsi is leaving office , but his day of triumph is not likely to end the political disputes in Egypt .	-4.3521
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn as the country ’ s first freely elected president , thereby advocating the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been displaced 16 months earlier .	-4.1234
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .	-3.1368
He deposed the oath before the court ’ s 18 black robes dressed judges , seated on the Nile and replied to an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.7356
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television .	-3.3305
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has been targeted sharply by the government since its foundation 84 years ago as a prohibited organisation .	-5.0342
Hundreds of soldiers and police guard the building when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small car convoy .	-3.4032
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to cheer the new president , and , unlike the presidential prunk of the Mubarak period , traffic was stopped only briefly so that the Autokonvoi could cross the usually lively road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-6.2944
As the brotherhood ’ s uncharismatic “ replacement wheel , ” his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists , but all those who wanted to bring to the fore the 2011 insurgency against authoritarian Mubarak .	-5.4486
“ Egypt is today a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” said Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took office .	-4.4497
Later Morsi went to the University of Cairo , where he was supposed to make his inauguration speech .	-3.7064
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem he listened to in hobby .	-11.4437
The military leader Feldmarshal Hussein Tantawi was present .	-2.0458
On his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of attendees in the largest auditorium of the university with speeches by “ The army and the people are a hand . ”	-5.0178
Established in 1908 as the bastion of secular education , the University of Cairo became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .	-3.8981
Morsi deposed a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square , the birthplace of the insurgency that led last year to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule , and he praised reclaiming presidential power that the military Council had assumed from the head of state driven out of .	-5.2852
But by putting the official oath before the court and not before Parliament as usual , he is bowing to the will of the military , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .	-4.9483
Morsi ’ s Tahir Square speech was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.7164

14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim , but in vain .	-3.0004
The sight of young people was so appalling that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance .	-9.1265
Kana had admitted during the process that he had actually been in a bar with boys .	-13.3517
He also admitted having beaten and raped them , but he denied being responsible for the death of the girl .	-3.4171
The police initially assumed several perpetrators , but released two suspects because the evidence against them was not enough .	-4.3093
The Public Prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack .	-2.9582
Rape is almost everyday in South Africa : there are some 64 000 advertisements every year for sexual violence .	-4.7617
That is nearly ten times the amount in Germany , but with 82 million people it has far more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-4.5985
The police and women ’ s associations in South Africa estimate the dark numbers of sexual violence between 10 and 25 times .	-4.9488
Jumbo visits the Black Forest Ham	-1.6875
Jumbo in search of the " best ham in the world " : For the TV show " Galileo " the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf .	-3.4115

Can ham that you get in any supermarket be a quality product ?	-3.4175
Uli , the head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest , explains Jumbo the working method of the company " Adler " in Bonndorf .	-4.3664

Most pigs are slaughtered at six months .	-1.4190
Television with level ?	-1.3373
Details such as the ph value of meat also play a role .	-2.6050
The darker the meat , the higher the ph value .	-1.5703
" I am excited when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then , " Jumbo says cynically .	-4.6998
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture .	-3.1465
But viewing is worthwhile .	-3.7515
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the culls is still handicraft .	-5.0384
Because Black Forest ham is traditionally found on the shelf without bones .	-3.1123
The secret of ham is the spice mix with salt .	-2.0157
Smoking tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo visually of a " submarine " .	-3.1524
The trick : fir branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham in the smoke .	-4.4643
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black .	-2.2808
" Now the disk disappears in the jumbo " , he announces the test feeding .	-3.1436
" He is really delicious " , according to the conclusion of the TV star .	-4.1444
This will enable everyone involved to live with it .	-7.6387

The travel company now expects adjusted pre-tax earnings of between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its earlier forecast .	-4.5699
If current targets are achieved , that means 12 to 17 % growth compared to the record gain of $ 290.4 million in the period 2011 / 12 .	-4.7591
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight percent of profits in the first half of the year and boosted a strong start in the second half , especially in Australian and British private business .	-13.1595
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on track towards record year revenues before interest and taxes , ” he said .	-4.7370
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically among our strongest earnings carriers .	-3.2438
In Australia , the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year , compensating for a slightly weaker market for business trips .	-3.1068
Similarly , Flight Centre ’ s leisure activities in the UK were good , while business customers spent less here , too .	-6.2223

Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries .	-2.6505
On the other hand , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-3.6579

Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-2.0524
The Ecumenical Talk Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parish of Salem , the Castle of Salem and the Cultural Office of the Bodenseekre.	-4.3516
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how people classify the " last things " after death today .	-4.3946
If people had known too much of it in recent centuries , putting on the images of heaven and hell , " which still shape our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion is more distinguished by a certain embarrassment or even linguistic lack . .	-7.8787
" The greater hope has been extended to Christians by religious criticism , " says the speaker .	-4.0076
They ' provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks ' .	-3.7500
Johanna Rahner continues to say , " But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death . "	-5.2992
This involves the question of the yearning , ' which dreams that everything will be good in the end ' .	-5.6507
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-2.0954

Ulrich Knobel informs you about this from the event sports club Illmensee .	-4.9281
Among the participants , especially at short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere .	-5.8579
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start of this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good positions at the German Championships .	-4.6291

For the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of the team nightmare that made it to the top of the winning staircase .	-4.6416
Anne Adel from Lake Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen came in place two and three .	-4.7718
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community .	-3.2610
Not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .	-3.9257
The age structure also ranged from ten years with the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest starters .	-4.5941
In the main race there were even more absolute topathletes at the start this year .	-4.3064
Four drivers were able to stand off from the regional top drivers .	-4.1286
Among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk Racing team .	-3.3280
Pangerl was twice the world champion in twelve-hour driving together with a team mate .	-4.6934

On the way through mud , rivers and jungle for free medical care	-2.8071
Dr. Georges Bwell brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon .	-2.2282
Bwell and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-3.8023
There are not many doctors in the West African country , but only one for 5,000 people .	-13.4686
Vote here or with your mobile device .	-2.6591
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ” .	-9.9247
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as the “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-3.3530
The winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-2.3449
For 21 years , Georges Bwave saw his sick father losing consciousness and travelling to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-4.2565
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-4.9897
At first he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation was formed that spread to his brain and caused a haematom that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.9446
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwelle .	-9.0631
We would have brought it out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.3560
Instead , Bwave spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-2.9278
“ It ’ s not easy , ” Bwelle comments .	-8.9773
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-3.2857
There are many patients .	-1.4128
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.5352
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell 's father died in 2002 .	-1.7404
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor per 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .	-3.1391
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 persons .	-3.7067
But even if there were a doctor for them , most cameras could not afford to visit .	-3.7914
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private .	-2.9572
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwell .	-2.0418
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.9674
His father and so many of his compatriots suffer in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it ripe .	-3.9070
Dr. Georges Bwell and his volunteer have carried out 700 free operations last year .	-2.7928
He became a doctor and worked as a vessel surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.3367
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.7405
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-2.5896
Almost every Friday , he forced up to 30 people into small buses and driving with the fitted medical equipment on the roof over untied terrain into the villages that need help .	-7.7627
Not always everything goes smoothly .	-1.9419
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-11.3407
But when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a feast , singing and dance , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .	-4.3869
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to be present at the cheerful celebration .	-6.2404
The next morning , the team will begin to examine hundreds of patients .	-3.0750
“ We treat 500 people per trip , ” says Bwell .	-3.9441
They come from a circle of 60 kilometres around the village – and this is on foot .	-4.6028
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.3386
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.3322
Others receive crutches , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.8443
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia .	-2.5213
The surgery usually takes place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the surgery the patients stand up and go into the recreation area to make room for the next .	-6.0694
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the group 's generator and thus work Bwave and his volunteers until the early hours of the morning on Sunday .	-4.8633
It is a strenuous pensum , but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .	-3.2201
“ They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says Bwell .	-4.2664
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.6341
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year , and knows that , in its work , it makes a huge difference to the people it helps .	-4.7277
A man explained that the free operation of a breach of bars he received now allows him to work again .	-4.9360
“ That changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.6005
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .	-3.4932
With this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , according to Bwell ; the rest comes from private donations .	-3.9173
“ I really don ’ t know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O ’ Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and voluntarily cooperates in Bwell ’ s group .	-3.7567
He is always at the hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-3.9722
For medical and nursing students like O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-4.0699
“ We can be involved in operations where we help to drop blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwell , ” explains O 'Malley .	-5.7350
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.0368
Students normally pay for their journey to Cameroon and bring frequently donated sanitation material .	-4.1568
Once they are in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over the accommodation , transport and instruction .	-5.0606
" He is undoubtedly a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.2534
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries .	-3.4739
For Bwell , almost permanent work is not a burden .	-3.4081
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he gave to his father gives him great pleasure .	-5.2685
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwell .	-2.6395
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.1960
I hope he will see what I do .	-1.6232
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-3.0230

Excellent Combat Mastered	-2.0613
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , has been cut on the body by Horst Janson .	-3.9370
Janson himself is an old hare in his career , the art of acting .	-4.9063
The old man of Santiago cannot be mistaken in fishing .	-5.2906
So the two simply complement each other great .	-4.4223
It is almost believed that the folds in the neck of the old man , of whom the fisherman Manolo speaks , can be seen .	-5.0705
If Santiago sits tired of life bowed on the chair , this is real at Janson .	-4.3317
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters .	-3.9804
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and eventually wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and also his willingness .	-4.5070
Janson is on stage as a solo actor .	-4.3981
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on himself , so that his monologues are not boring for a moment .	-8.4215
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue lit water bottles .	-4.1323
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.3196
In the course of the performance , he brings to light the respective active scene : the hut of Santiago , the bar of singer Marie-Luise favor , who , with her songs and her splendid voice , sings Cuba ’ s feeling of life .	-12.2005
The four musicians play Cuba 's rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.3221
Tourism : descent to the Romans	-2.1350
A sewage channel from the Roman era is preserved at about 120 metres in length below Cologne .	-4.4864
If you are visiting Cologne , don 't miss the Duomo .	-3.8001
Around 157 metres , the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-4.4939
However , only a few visitors who admire the two delicate church towers suggest that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-13.7181
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne 's underworld .	-2.0591
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne Tourism directly at the Dom .	-4.5527
The tour starts completely unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-3.2785
In the seventies , the city fathers wanted a car-like city , and therefore the remains of the old wall remained only that which was not too big .	-6.9286
Most of the users of the car park are therefore also rushing past the Roman remains and are only stopping their car .	-8.2902
But those who look more closely discover an archaeological site separated by metallic bars in Parkdeck D2 .	-4.7491
There are about five meters high ruins made of handheld stones .	-5.1200
" There are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " says Schulze .	-3.7236
Before returning to the daylight , Schulze leaves the participants at the upper level to take a look at a dark , 15-metre deep shaft .	-6.2431
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly perceived .	-3.7403
Next station of the tour is the pre-torium , and here the participants go down to the depth again .	-6.6611
Here we are witnessing the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the Praetor of the CCAA .	-3.9670
What CCAA means , a visitor wants to know .	-2.2624
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which in good German means " City of Roman law and city of Agrippinenser , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the Kaiserkult " .	-4.0591
And the Praetorium is the former Statthalter Palace , the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-3.7394
From the front of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is preserved here at about 120 metres in length .	-5.0020
" You can quietly walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want " , Schulze invites the guests .	-4.9162
Schulze still has a surprise .	-1.6685
After getting the key at the checkout , it leads the group to a 16-metre deep , walkable shaft .	-4.9258
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.9922
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .	-3.8575
To this day , in the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine .	-5.2308
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square , for which the construction work will begin shortly .	-11.4719
However , a few years will pass by until completion .	-4.5680
Almost hacked : New edition of Rocker Process	-4.0567
A bloody attack in the rock milieu is reopened after more than four years .	-2.6257
A trial of attempted deaths , dangerous bodily injury and material damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the District Court of Frankfurt ( Oder ) .	-5.9035
It is accompanied by strict safety measures .	-2.2327
The defendants remain silent to the start .	-3.1885
They were supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and belonged to the bandidos at the time .	-5.0173
The Public Prosecutor ’ s Office accuses them of stumbling in a car in June 2009 with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt .	-4.9752
All victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-2.1512
The victims are supposed to have been part of the competing group of Hell ’ s Angels .	-3.7593
One should have been a high-level member of Berlin .	-3.1796
The preceding was apparently a tracking hunt with several cars .	-5.1224
According to the indictment , it was about revival fights and a demonstration of power .	-4.8232
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial in early 2012 .	-3.1208
A court spokesman said at the time that it was not possible to prove that men had actually been involved in the bloody feud .	-4.1204
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .	-2.0718
The Federal Court lifted the judgment after revision of the Prosecutor 's Office and referred it back to the District Court for further negotiations .	-4.5639
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence .	-3.1293
The first step was the reconstruction of the processes in fact .	-5.9283
The Commissioner who was investigating at the time was invited to witness .	-4.2218
The focus was on mobile calls from the defendants and other people who had intercepted the police .	-4.7935
It is difficult that Rockers almost always comply with a law of their own , not say .	-13.2024
This also applies to the victims .	-1.7206
In the first trial , only one of the victims had unpacked .	-3.2943
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the public prosecutor Frankfurt ( Oder ) said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last trial .	-4.3543
The process will have eleven more days of negotiations .	-4.3050
The Disposable Society does not think so .	-3.6686
The night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .	-3.0377
But hunger becomes apparent in the premises of people on the front-passenger and back seat .	-4.5118
Of course , some cocktails or champagne may be responsible for this !	-4.2477
What is closer than going to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a small thing ?	-5.3596
I admit that I am happy to be part of this when it comes to fast food holding late night or early morning .	-6.4230
A few Pommes , a Cola , a burger - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-3.6846
But on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gears are noticeable .	-5.0434
Because what is missing is that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window regularly ?	-5.3733
Especially on weekends , paper bags are thrown away on the edges of the street and on parking spaces .	-12.8567
" Why ? " I wonder .	-1.9378
Are the people too doof to take the bags home respectively to the next bin ?	-3.1822
It is not only the case that the paper vehicle is shirking the landscape .	-5.0020
Bags have already hidden transport facilities such as guidelines , causing accidents .	-4.8134
But she does not think about what this term means , presumably she does not even know what that word actually means .	-6.2223
If you are travelling more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know what a backbank can look like after celebrated nights : clothes , bottles and other garbage tower .	-6.4432
There would be some bags more or less nix , unlike the street , where nobody wants to trample on the food remains of others .	-6.8485
I already see the day when cities and municipalities are becoming bloody - and the fast-food chains must demand deposits for their bags .	-12.7659
Obama ’ s Health-Policy R	-2.3782
After strong criticism yesterday , President Obama withdrew from his often repeated , unambiguous promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-4.7160
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of cancellation , the Republicans accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days .	-3.7401
Yesterday , Obama relativized his original promise .	-1.2936
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.3487
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals , Obama called on those Americans who have received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market .	-9.3682
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted .	-4.0492
“ They come a better offer , ” he said .	-2.8798
The government described it as little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have themselves completed insurance would have to look for a different rate , because their treaty does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-5.9481
“ I want to say to these Americans directly : they deserve better , ” said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .	-4.0393
Sebelius , responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , declared that the launch of the online platform has been “ absurd ” since October .	-3.1604
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-2.5653
I am determined to regain your confidence .	-1.4164
This speech by an elaborate Sebelius to be a behind her sitting adviser at yesterday 's House hearing was taken after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri , whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-6.9976
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question of why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ architect ” did not voluntarily renounce state-sponsored insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov , which it now wants to sell to millions of Americans .	-5.4701
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attacks on Syrian Air Force Base	-2.5718
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air base in Syria ’ s Latakia a day earlier .	-4.6041
The aim was ' missiles and equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-4.0809
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab transmitter Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia was shot on Thursday night , from Wednesday to Thursday , and the Israelis blamed for it .	-5.0141
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia , where Russian defense missiles of the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles , which , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads of up to 70 kilograms .	-10.3291
Unsure The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.6768
However , the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official in saying that he believes that Israel has executed the attack , but is not sure .	-4.9295
In any case , a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.5064
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in Yedioth Ahronoth ’ s daily newspaper that the Syrian regime tried , partly successfully , to deliver ground air missiles to Hezbollah earlier .	-4.2751
The Israeli Government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a " red line " that would follow a military response .	-3.5830
John Kerry declares , in an unprecedented admission , that US espionage has “ gone inappropriately far too far ”	-9.1317
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , suggested a softening of the US ’ s defensive attitude to its surveillance programs by saying that espionage has , in certain cases , “ gone inappropriately too far . ”	-5.0856
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for switching to “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA ’ s spy activities became public .	-4.2141
The leaked information has left the US government in a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .	-3.1976
As Kerry said in a speech broadcast by video at the London Open Governance Conference , “ There is no doubt that the President and I , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that have been almost autopilot simply because there was the ability to do what was still due to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , to 11 September . ”	-8.9211
He then became the first senior member of the US government to admit that the US espionage had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-4.3064
He said : ‘ In some cases this has gone too far inadequately . ’	-3.4590
The President is determined to clarify and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation , so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here .	-5.1763
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process are not affected .	-2.6383
Kerry , however , insisted that the NSA was a force of good and had saved many lives through their surveillance operations .	-11.7008
He added , “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up . ”	-10.0088
There is a radical extremism in the world that is reluctant to kill people , blow up the air , and attack governments .	-3.8973
So what if we were able to intercept and stop this before it happens ?	-3.1263
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have heard about such plans in advance .	-4.2910
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about the alleged American espionage and persuade Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in the anti-terrorist efforts , as the chairman of the European Affairs Subcommittee declared on Thursday .	-5.5350
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency 's monitoring .	-4.7730
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who is a Democrat in the Senate for the first time and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-5.2329
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes .	-3.8991
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , even though this week the head of the intelligence service said that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.5186
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden that the NSA has monitored the mobile phone by Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-4.0239
The head of the national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this is common on both sides .	-4.1728
In all this tumult , Murphy said that his authority is preparing the trip of the Congress to take place this year , hoping that the delegation will include members of both parties and chambers .	-4.2839
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.4042
He said that the exact route is still being prepared .	-2.5927
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.5517
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spy programmes they themselves have been using for years .	-3.9202
“ While we can change our monitoring programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , ” says Murphy .	-4.9389
Meanwhile , John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with resentment about the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .	-3.9418
A stubborn injury on the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the FSV Mainz 05 Federal Foreign Game at the FC Augsburg .	-4.3126
Mainz snags about a deployment of Nicolai Müller .	-3.4242
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team .	-1.2956
So far he could only do that individually .	-2.9259
" We will decide on his deployment in the short term , " said Trainer Thomas Tuchel .	-3.1159
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeeper with six hits .	-3.5602

Australian appeal against prison sentence in Thailand	-3.0228
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced in Phuket to 15 days in prison because she wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the judgment and was released on bail .	-4.4381
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of having made a false statement after indicating to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her during the morning hours of Sunday 10 June , while two other men detained her .	-4.9953
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had securely entered her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend .	-4.3829
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to have thought out history .	-3.9080
Until the trial it was in police detention on the ground .	-3.7570
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the edge of Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .	-3.5229
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy-League , who appealed to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra to help his daughter .	-4.3613
Tunks told Sydney ’ s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have her back in Australia .	-3.5979
“ We are of course very concerned , but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.7475
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on free foot .	-2.9533
In Australian reports , she has been on holiday in Krabi in South Thailand in the meantime .	-5.3231
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for ad. . to .	-5.5682
However , it is also possible that , following the recent murder of the shopping cart Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand might seek to improve its struggling tourist image , and that is why there is an acquisition .	-7.0860
