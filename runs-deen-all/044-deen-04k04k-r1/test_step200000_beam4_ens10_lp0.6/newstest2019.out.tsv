Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on name change , said he would ignore the vote .	-2.2642

Sainsbury plans to conquer the British beauty market	-1.5728
Sainsbury 's takes over boats , superdrug and Debenhams with shelves with beauty products in the style of the department store , filled with specialist assistants .	-5.5451
Within the framework of an extensive push into the UK beauty market , which continues to grow and is worth $ 2.8bn , fashion and homeware sales will fall .	-4.9022
The idea of investing in the beauty market has arisen from the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf square , which was previously used for televisions , microwaves and household goods for new products .	-5.1548
Sainsbury announced that the range of beauty products is doubled to 3000 products by including brands such as Revlon , Essie , Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw in the product portfolio for the first time .	-3.4012
Also existing assortments of L 'Oreal , Maybelline and Burt 's Bees will be given more place in brand areas , similar to those found in shops such as boats .	-4.6922
The supermarket chain also revives its in-house makeup brand “ Boutique ” , which has many popular vegan products on offer for young buyers .	-4.8764
In addition , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop tests concessions in two Sainsbury stores , which opened the first week in Croydon , South London , while opening a second end of this year in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-4.1294
Online shopping and a shift toward daily shopping of small quantities of food in neighbourhood shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit .	-4.1856
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury 's , said that sales outlets will increasingly look like warehouses , as the supermarket chain tries to combat discounters like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-4.0087
Sainsbury 's placed Argos Outlets in hundreds of shops and also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , allegedly strengthening food sales and making acquisitions more profitable .	-3.6862
The supermarket 's earlier attempt to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended with a failure .	-4.9865
Sainsbury has tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000 ’ s , but it ended in divisions , and the revenue from the shops of pharmacies could not be shared .	-4.6629
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold its 281 branch pharmacy business three years ago for <unk> 125 million to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyd Pharmacy chain .	-3.1182
According to the figures , Lloyds is also expected to participate , and four Lloyds stores intend to extend the range of luxury skin care products from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy .	-6.1637
Paul Mills-Hicks , Head of Sainsbury , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our shelves for beauty products to improve the equipment for our customers .	-3.6775
In addition , we have invested in the training of employees , who are supposed to provide advice to the customer .	-4.9789
Our brand portfolio leaves nothing to be desired .	-2.5462

The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and it was assumed that Willoughby ’ s assets would double by an estimated <unk> 11 million .	-3.6883
When Willoughby , 37 , announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly , Jones left Britain and flew to one of his holiday homes .	-2.3104
One source said , ' It was really high on Holly 's list of priorities ' .	-2.9152
It should be its long-term future and secure it for decades to come .	-2.6333
Their decision to withdraw was totally stubbornly left behind by all parties .	-5.2805
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday – so close to the start .	-2.7673
" At Marlow HQ there is a warehouse full of goods that can be sold " .	-2.5995
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning moderator , one of the most bankable stars in Britain , could cost the company millions because they have invested very heavily in products such as pillows , candles , clothing , and homewear , and the potential for further delays in introducing the market .	-5.0196
And it could mean the end of a long friendship .	-1.7107
For ten years Willoughby and his husband , Dan Baldwin , Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been close .	-2.2929
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones , 52 , joined the chairman in March .	-2.4096
The couples make together vacation and Jones has a 40-percent share of Baldwin 's TV production company .	-3.3090
Willoughby is to become a trademark ambassador for M & S and replace Ant McPartlin as a host of ITV 's I 'm A Celebrity .	-2.9600
A source of information around Jones said yesterday evening : ' We would not comment on his business matters ' .	-3.5577
Tough talk , and then we fell in love .	-1.8082
He joked at the criticism he would receive from the news media because he had made a comment that some would regard as " unprivileged " and because he so positively judged the North Korean leader .	-5.6076
Why has President Trump made so many compromises ?	-1.4001
This was what Trump said in his mocked “ news speaker . ”	-3.1868
‘ I have not made compromises ’ .	-2.3217
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed her first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea ’ s denuclearization .	-3.0357

More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June , Ri Yong Ho , North Korea ’ s leading diplomat , told the United Nations leaders , and General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a ' corresponding response ' from the US to North Korea ’ s early disarmament measures .	-4.1242
Instead , he argued , the US continues the sanctions to maintain pressure .	-3.4784
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his rally speech .	-2.8711
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.3039
“ We wanted to wage war with North Korea .	-1.2266
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.8071
Now we have this great relationship ” .	-1.9132
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results , such as the end of missile tests , the liberation of hostages , and the transfer of the mortal remains of American soldiers home .	-3.4015
And he defended his unusual approach when he talked about relations with Kim .	-1.9363
" It is so easy to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this packed arena , about 200 people would stand there , " Trump said , showing the crowd directly before him .	-5.6774
In Indonesia , a tsunami and an earthquake kill hundreds and devastate an island .	-1.2308
After the Lombok earthquake , for example , foreign NGOs were told that they would not be needed .	-11.3381
Although more than 10 % of Lombok ’ s population has been relocated , no national disaster has been declared , a prerequisite for catalysing international aid .	-3.6866
Sumbung said : ' Unfortunately , in many cases , they have made it very clear that they do not request international aid , so it is a small challenge ' ,	-4.0431
While Save the Children puts together a team to travel to Palu , it is not yet certain whether foreign staff can work on site .	-3.9687
The spokesman of the National Civil Protection Agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations can contribute to the aid measures .	-2.9681
Unfortunately , given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly enduring , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-3.6949
While the tsunami areas were built in Aceh , which is not common for other coastlines .	-4.5000
The obvious absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu , although a warning was already in force , should have contributed to the loss of life .	-3.7880
Even under favourable conditions , travelling between the many Indonesian islands is difficult .	-2.6787
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated .	-1.1372
A Lazarette vessel stationed for the treatment of the earthquake victims in Lombok is on its way to Palu , but it will take at least three days to arrive at the place of the new disaster .	-4.6846

But financing deficits have plagued Mr. Joko ’ s government , even though he faces his re-election next year .	-2.6765
Mr Joko is also under pressure from persistent religious tensions in Indonesia , where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith .	-2.2685
Over 1000 people were killed , and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs gave rise to street struggles with machetes , arrows , and arches , and other primitive weapons .	-4.3238

The statue of Parliament of Cromwell will rewrite the recent success of the History series .	-4.2460
His exile would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction by his fanatical Puritan followers of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England .	-3.6580
However , the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick 's proposal as " folly " and as a " attempt to rewrite history . "	-7.8102
John Goldsmith , Chairman of the Cromwell Society , said : “ Given the current debate on the removal of statues , it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell ’ s figure would be targeted at the Westminster Palace . ”	-3.2642
Cromwell did not arrange or perform the picture storm of the English civil wars .	-5.7161
Perhaps the wrong cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century .	-2.3208
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft ’ s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell bears witness to the view that prevailed in the nineteenth century , and still prevails in parts of history : that Cromwell is worth celebrating .	-5.0152
Mr Goldsmith said about the Sunday Telegraph : ‘ Cromwell is regarded by many , perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today , as defenders of Parliament against external pressure , in his case of course the monarchy .	-4.0585
Whether this is an absolutely correct representation is the subject of the continued historical debate .	-3.1263
To be sure , the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the future development of our nation , and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that stands for one side of the divide .	-4.1127
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth remembering and celebrating them . ”	-2.0541

On 2 October 1968 , troops had ended a peaceful demonstration of leftist student groups with weapons , killing around 300 people .	-4.1234
Lopez Obrador has promised monthly financial support for Mexican students and opening further free public universities .	-3.1788
He said that , because of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities , young people are caught up in criminal gangs .	-5.1098
The US should double artificial intelligence spending	-2.4974
While China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investments , Kai-Fu Lee says , investor , and AI practitioners who have worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple . .	-3.4349
These demands arose after US government officials made announcements about AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.7063
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-4.0523
“ Doubling spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is on the verge , ” Lee said .	-13.2390
Doubling funding could double the chances of achieving the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.5588
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpower : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( KI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the New World Order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese AI companies , Face + + .	-3.5980
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest American Othello player , and later became leader of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google .	-5.4317
Lee acknowledged the former US government technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Authority ) , and asked when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-4.1211
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain state subsidies , ” said Lee .	-3.1173
“ It is not China that is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but the companies , ” Lee noted .	-4.1002
In recent years , Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have recruited university coryphaes to work on AI .	-4.2368
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-3.2967
“ I think Green Cards should automatically be offered PhD students in AI , ” he said .	-3.6088
The Chinese Council of State presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017 .	-2.2053
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-3.7589
Earlier this year , the US Department of Defense has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industrial and scientific partners , and the White House has announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-3.2883
And this month , DARPA announced an investment of $ 2 billion in an initiative called “ AI Next . ”	-2.1938
With regard to the NSF , it is currently investing more than $ 100 million per year in AI research .	-11.3784
Meanwhile , US legislation , which wanted to create a national security commission for artificial intelligence , has not been heard for months .	-4.1129
Macedonia will vote in a referendum on whether to change the country ’ s name .	-11.0470
On Sunday , the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change their name in ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its accession bids for the European Union and NATO .	-3.9931
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a territorial claim to the Greek territory and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.0039
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia .	-2.4335
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and , in the face of a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the result will create the 50 % obstacle , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-4.1184
The question on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.5915
Proponents of name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth the price of continuing admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.4887
“ I came today to vote on the future of the country , and it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.4608
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will abide by the outcome of the vote so that it becomes crucial .	-3.6083
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name .	-2.5145
The Landtag election committee said at around 1 p.m. that there had been no reports of irregularities .	-4.6880
But turnout was only 16 % – at the same time , at the last parliamentary election in 2016 , the figure was 34 % , and in the end 66 % of registered voters voted .	-4.9237
“ I voted for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-3.1912
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica , and his son Dushko have voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the amendment of the country ’ s name , which would pave the way for him to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.5029
In front of the Skopje Parliament , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , has prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents put forward by those who will boycott the referendum .	-4.4810
" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads up , not through the service door , " Kavadarkov said .	-3.0562
“ We live in a poor country , but we too have our dignity .	-1.8632
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.7727
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with a unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-1.8313
“ I believe a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” said Zaev after voting .	-3.6571
According to him , the result “ yes ” would be a “ strengthening of our future . ”	-3.2323
Last Monday , the Macedonian Policy Research Institute published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would thus participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-3.0653
Another survey conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.1500
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said “ yes ” .	-3.1889
The referendum will only be adopted if the turnout is over 50 % .	-2.8144
Failure to hold the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policies since they took office last May .	-9.7898
View : Sergio Agüero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton defense on the way to the gate .	-3.0264
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling completed Brighton ’ s defense at the Manchester City-2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-2.4934
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute incredibly simple .	-1.9838
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine storm received a pass in the middle field .	-3.7516
He tricked out three defenders from Brighton to free himself .	-3.3673
Then Agüero saw himself surrounded by three green shirts .	-1.8796
He bypassed a defender before running several players on the edge of the Brighton penal fr. . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.9765
Then he made a passport to the left and left to Sterling .	-3.7282
The English storm used his first contact to play back the ball to Agüero , who then shot with the right – past Brighton torwart Mathew Ryan to the right side of the gate .	-6.0631
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City-Manager Pep Guardiola to the reporters .	-2.4310
“ We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.4943
That has happened .	-1.2170
Fortunately , he shot a gate at the moment . ”	-1.7911
However , it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues at the Premier League Duel :	-3.2917
The gate came in the 29th minute	-2.0204
In the game , Aguero was played deep in the territory of Brighton .	-3.3135
with a beautiful steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side .	-2.6679
Sane made a few touches before he led sterling to the remote post .	-3.1791
The Sky Blues played the ball forward into the net before they slipped out of the field .	-3.5856

Scherzer wants to play sportsmen against Rockies . . . . and . . . . . , .	-8.9546
Since the national players were excluded from the Playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-4.0319
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to be able to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still playoff implications for the rockies that have a lead from a game before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-4.4164
The Rockies won at least one place on Friday evening with a 5 : 2 win over the nationals , but the title win in the first league is still not safe .	-5.2606
" Even if we play for free , we can at least teach ourselves , because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best that we have to offer this year .	-10.0087
Why should I not try to do so ? '	-2.8942
The nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to let Scherzer throw in such a situation .	-3.5652
Scherzer , who would make his 34th start , threw an upward tour on Thursday and threw in his normal rest day .	-4.1175

Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives .	-2.7390
This is one of the big , big - I do not stand , but I really stand , so I fight everywhere for great candidates , he said .	-4.5372
Trump continues : “ You see this terrible , terrible radical Democrat group , you see that it is happening now .	-3.9993
And they are determined to regain power with all the necessary means , and they do not stop at bosh times and communities . . . . , , . , , . , , , , ,	-11.1152
They do not care about whom they hurt , whom they have to cross to get power and control , that is what they want , power and control , we will not give them .	-5.1107
“ The Democrats ’ goal is to oppose and block themselves , ” he said .	-2.4545
" And you see this in the last four days , " he said and called the Democrats " angry and common , evil and untrue " .	-4.0815
" He notably referred to the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein , a senior member of the Senate Legal Affairs Committee , and thus harvested loud cry from the audience .	-4.6282
" Do you remember their answer ?	-1.8599
Have you left the document ?	-1.9637
No , what .	-0.7042
No , ah no , I , moment – that was really bad body language – the worst body language I have ever seen . ”	-2.8790
The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.4823
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.9211
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-1.7681
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs who say that we are not welcome - only because we have said our opinion .	-10.7662
My group colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism .	-3.2755
In my case , I have been criticised by the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.1895

The communication for the East Labour meeting in Nottingham on Friday says : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-2.6737
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP , the GC meetings on Friday evening were exactly the same .	-3.1459
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , softer ' policy has long been forgotten , if it has ever begun . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-10.9709
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership .	-3.8631
This began shortly after Jeremy took office , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude expected me to take a turnaround and adopt positions with which I would never otherwise have agreed , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-6.0692
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in the social media , which calls for election , denounces the policy of the centre , and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-4.6081
This experience has not only been my experience .	-3.9176
I know , in fact , that there is more luck than some of my fellow Members , because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political .	-4.5519
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members , who are exposed to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day , but never frighten .	-4.9834
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the extent of abuse has normalized .	-2.2364
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.4943
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules , the party will become smaller .	-4.4595
Over the last two years , I have been given plenty of advice on getting my neck in , not being so vocal , and then I would be “ right . ”	-6.4677
That is why I have not come into politics .	-2.8315
Thirty-two years ago , as a student , I joined Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , and this neglect had meant that my classroom had literally collapsed , and as a result I tried to work for better public services for those who need them most , whether as a municipal council or minister .	-10.2430
I have never hidden my political views , not even at the last election .	-2.6546
As far as my political positions are concerned , nobody in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way , and the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.1176
To those who supported the request on Friday , I would just like to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and to the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that harms households , businesses and our public services .	-4.7090
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham momentum , but about my constituents , whether Labour Members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not stop any threats to vote or political opportunities from working in what I think is the best interest of all of you .	-5.8157

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr unbeaten at the top of the rac.	-8.1485
Two late Tries may have distorted the final result somewhat , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's Premiership Match of the day .	-3.4463
They are now the only unbeaten of the ten teams to list .	-3.4731
In the end , it was because of the superior defence of the host , but also because of the better use of opportunities .	-7.4008
" We were tested so far by our games and we are still unbeaten , so I have to be happy , " he said .	-2.8782
Robyn Christie von Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have used their chances better . ”	-2.5696
Grant Anderson ’ s 14th minute attempt , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , given for the game by Warriors , allowed Melrose to have numbers speak , and Jason Baggot to grab an unchanged attempt .	-13.6902
Climo stretched the leadership of Ayr with a punishment before reaching a hit directly at the half-time and then made a solo request that he succeeded in the 17 : 5 pause tour for Ayr .	-7.4641
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transform from baggage , reduced the lag to five points .	-3.8948
After the reboot , Ayr expanded the leadership when a Try of Stafford McDowall-by Climo was transformed .	-5.7242
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and again Melrose left the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt to pay at the end of a curse of violent pressure .	-3.7775
But the home side came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because of a tackling without ball of Climo from the penalty line , MacPherson made a touchdown , the advancing Ayr in the back .	-4.4710
Climo converted , as almost after the restart , after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong 's boxkick and sent the wing storm Gregor Henry by passport to Try number five .	-5.6172

Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are motto : “ The sea belongs to us by legal means .	-4.6653
It is a duty to recover .	-2.1114
Throughout the enclosed Bolivia , the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive - as is the longing to return to the Pacific .	-4.1217
These hopes may be at their peak for decades , as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations .	-4.1784
" Bolivia has the dynamics , the spirit of unity and serenity and , of course , expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.2744
Many Bolivians will follow the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country , hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will find Bolivia ’ s claim to be preferred to negotiate after decades of troubled talks in order to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-5.4455
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic indigenous president – facing a controversial struggle for re-election next year – much depends on Monday ’ s decision .	-3.0972
“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he commended at the end of August .	-2.3835
However , some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not change .	-3.8646
The Dutch UN institution has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-4.0912
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after the final arguments were heard shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-4.3990
And far from pushing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years may have postponed it .	-4.0581
“ The question of sea access is being used by the current Bolivian government for its purposes , ” said Zárate .	-3.5777
Moral warlike rhetoric had destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , she proposed .	-2.8545
Bolivia and Chile will eventually resume the negotiations , but it will be difficult to continue the talks after that .	-3.7988
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962 .	-1.3443
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé , Bolivia ’ s representative in The Hague , rejected the idea that the court decided unusually quickly .	-2.4573
Monday will offer Bolivia “ an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile ” and an opportunity to “ put an end to 139 years of differences of mutual benefit , ” he said .	-4.0695
Calzadilla also denied that Morales , who continues to be one of Latin America ’ s most popular presidents , uses the question of sea access politically for his purposes .	-3.6200
“ Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean , ” he added .	-1.6165
“ The result is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past . ”	-1.8988
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not come unless it can trust the US .	-1.4842
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never defuse its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington .	-2.3136
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday .	-1.4242
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit of the two rival leaders in Singapore .	-2.6162
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume the diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament held on ice three months after the meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore .	-3.1130
Ri says that it is “ a dream ” that continued sanctions and the US ’ s contradiction to a declaration that ends the Korean war will ever bring the North to its knees .	-4.4599
Washington wants to agree to the declaration that Pyongyang has taken comprehensive disarmament measures .	-3.3486
Both Kim and the US President Donald Trump want a second summit .	-1.1903
It is widely questioned , however , that Pyongyang does not have his arms arsenal , which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security .	-5.6834
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Trump and Kim .	-1.6888

Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy , oversized heads for their SS19 collection on the catwalk that inspired the style of Paris Fashion Week .	-4.2816
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer , and these designers sent their striking creations over the catwalk .	-3.2357
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat , decorated with a spring wide edge that flooded the heads of the models .	-4.1929
Other oversized accessories were watermelons with jewellery , a magic hat and even an anaesthetic , but they are not intended to keep the head warm .	-4.3455
Thom Brown showed a number of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween .	-1.8573
Many of the colourful masks had lips sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Couture .	-3.9801
A creation resembled the scuba equipment with snorkel and glasses , while another looked like a melted ice cup .	-4.2757
And if you have this incredible fashion trend , you will be lucky .	-2.7440
Style observers predict that the giant hats could take their way to the main roads nearby .	-4.5228
The oversized hats have glued to the heels of " La Bomba " , the straw hat with a 60 cm wide edge , which can be seen at each of Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski .	-4.9557
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat sprayed by Social Media sent another great creation onto the catwalk - a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the bathing suit model she was carrying .	-5.3328
The orange bag , filled with Raffia hem and with a white leather handle , was the outstanding piece in Jacquemus ' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week .	-3.8222
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said FEMAIL : " I expect to see large hats and bags in the main streets next summer , because the designer has such a great influence , it is difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories . "	-5.0648

Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of top academic quality , which continued with outstanding results in 2018 , as well as individual and group successes in sport , art , music and other community activities .	-5.7712
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , seek to offer their students and parents the best level of service .	-3.2679
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for further education , including at universities , for their desired careers , and for their role as world citizens .	-4.6318
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made schooling curriculum , whereby modern languages are still popular and desired in schools .	-4.6793
Nelson Mandela once said , “ If you talk to a person in the language he understands , you will reach his mind . ”	-3.3572
When you speak with him in his own language , it goes to his heart . ”	-3.1396
This makes it impressive that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries .	-3.6880
The results of this year show that languages are at the forefront of tables with the highest quotas in independent schools .	-3.7455
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called “ Higher grade A ” higher class A .	-3.8490
The data collected by the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while 72 , 69 and 63 attended Note A among the students who learned German , French and Spanish .	-5.0057
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-2.6392
Language subjects have the same rank in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-3.2496
A 2014 British Commission survey on Employment and Qualifications revealed that 17 % of the reasons employers had difficulty filling vacancies are attributable to a lack of linguistic knowledge .	-4.3211
As a result , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-3.7104
Given the more promising employment opportunities that languages require , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-3.3601
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when learning a second language , he will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong ability like this .	-4.0843
Through the possibility of communicating directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competitors .	-3.2122
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to talk , and French is the only language spoken with a double-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.5479
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-3.3971
When children learn to speak several languages – especially those of developing countries – they will later have better opportunities to find meaningful employment in the labour market .	-3.7425
The schools in Scotland differ in their language offerings .	-3.3136
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese , will teach .	-3.1938
Whatever your child 's interests , there will always be a number of languages available in independent schools , with teachers specialised in this field .	-3.8353
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that is well prepared for children , and they should be given the necessary tools for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-5.3016
In today ’ s global business world , languages are undeniably still important for the country ’ s future , and this must also be reflected in education .	-3.6244
Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.7442
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice , diversity and top quality .	-2.4237

Trump will certainly respond to this week ’ s hearings on accusations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court candidate , Brett Kavanaugh , who has been postponed for at least a week until the FBI investigations have been completed .	-5.3898
But the main objective of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans , who will be facing a decisive election in November .	-4.4454
According to Reuters , Trump ’ s campaign aims to mobilize volunteers and supporters with next week ’ s five election meetings to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-3.2354
“ The majority in Congress is primarily on the president ’ s agenda , which is why he visits as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent campaign season , ” said a speaker of the Trump campaign , who does not want to be named Reuters .	-12.0678
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , this evening ’ s Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract support from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-3.6132
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points , will visit for the second time this month .	-2.1174

Ryder Cup 2018 : The US Team is ready to fight to maintain the hope of Sunday Singles	-3.4896
After three one-sided encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.4248
The vibrating pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that the players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-4.0231
So where would they say the momentum now ?	-2.7140
“ They have had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so we probably have a bit of momentum , ” said Jordan Spieth , when he withdrew for the day . ”	-5.1306
Europe is , of course , in the advantage of 4 points , and twelve more are still to be played .	-9.6950
The Americans , as Spieth says , feel a little wind in their sails and there was much encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and each of three out of four points .	-4.8366
Spieth was superior from the outset and set an example .	-3.4931
These bold jubilee cries became louder when his round continued , he poured a decisive putt to reach a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas left 2 points after 2 matches .	-6.3332
His joy at the putt on the 15th hole with which she won the game was such that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-4.1850
" You really have to concentrate heavily and worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.6453
This is all that remains for each of these players .	-4.1251
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.8205
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-3.0189
Europe 's strange but admirable couple is playing flawlessly and simply doing everything right .	-3.5976
" Moliwood " was the only couple who didn 't get a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning the rear nine .	-4.3653
This course and the way in which their energy appears to flow to and from this abandoned crowd makes it the favorite on Sunday , and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player sealing a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-5.6617
Probably both at different holes at the same time .	-2.5542
Speaking of a European victory now would be too hasty .	-3.1326
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia , who won with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-10.0834
With a bogey and two doubles at the first nine pits , the Spaniards and the Swede entered a hole from which they never came out again .	-4.3801
On Sunday there is no one to help you out of your hole .	-3.5374
Because of the interactions between couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change quickly , it is very fascinating to observe the fourballs and foursomes from close proximity .	-5.4031
Europe , as a team , has played better and taken on a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome session has also shown that the US team has the desire to fight , which some , especially Stateside , have doubted .	-6.8388
Europe leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.6912
Europe will take advantage of a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from the four-and-four-game game on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-5.1885
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to score four points in the Le Golf National .	-3.9608
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who fought for the preservation of the trophy she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated an American team fighting with suspension in the morning fourball , and won the series with 3-1 .	-5.8201
The US offered more resistance in the fours and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.4497
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 singles of Sunday to keep the trophy .	-3.3229
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second couple winning four points from their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.5038
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat a sobered wood and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.7299
Woods , who ran through two matches on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four and seven consecutive .	-15.3286
Justin Rose , rested for the morning fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Fourmomes and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-3.6151
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.5002
On Saturday , the three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points .	-3.4426
They won a bold 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after they lost the first two holes .	-3.8065
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Halter Furyk 's site needs only a draw to keep the trophy .	-4.0752
After two days of second best time , however , a Sunday account looks like he would go beyond it .	-4.7338
North Korea says that there will be “ no ” unilateral disarmament without confidence .	-2.9237
North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its mistrust of the United States , and that under such circumstances , the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.6153
Ri Yong Ho told the world body 's annual General Assembly that last year North Korea took " significant goodwill measures " , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of nuclear testing grounds , and the commitment not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-5.4759
" However , there is no response from the USA , " he said .	-3.1142
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we disarm ourselves unilaterally first . ”	-3.8150
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s resistance to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his explanation seemed significant , insofar as it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.3954
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit meeting between an acting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 , when Kim committed himself to " declaring the Korean Peninsula " while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea 's security .	-4.3531
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons .	-2.9478
Washington has also opposed calls for a relaxation of the tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-9.5267
The US insists on " denuclearization first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a mandatory manner , and even reject the " declaration of the end of the war " , said Ri .	-4.7542
" The perception that sanctions can force us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us .	-3.3491
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust . ”	-2.0316
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim and Trump summit , highlighted by the US President at the United Nations earlier this week .	-2.9505
Instead , the minister raised three meetings between Kim and South Korea ’ s leader , Moon Jae-, in the last five months , and added : ' If the party were South Korea , not the US , on this issue of denuclearization , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end ' .	-4.8064
Yet the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called a “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-4.1263
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ completely destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament , but he also said that a great deal of work had to be done , and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea destroyed nuclear denuclearization .	-4.6822
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no time frame for this , saying : ' It doesn 't matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-4.0051
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.3233
However , in the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN . Security Council on Thursday that : ' Implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorous and without any further deficiency until we implement complete , final and verified denuclearisation ' .	-6.0241
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the funding of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programs .	-2.7643
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly , and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.1638
Pompeo already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-3.1359
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress had been made , and only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him to make “ gangster demands . ”	-4.3201
In a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile location and also a nuclear complex if the United States took ' appropriate action ' .	-4.6990
He said that Kim told him that the " appropriate measures " he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.0563
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace and quiet .	-2.9652
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing Macho culture of studying caffeine enveloped " mixed nights " .	-5.2213
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.9255
Charles Czeisler , Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believes is the first of his kind in the US .	-3.8543
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep shortages on learning .	-3.5290
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is this only now , in my final year ?	-4.7805
She said that she never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he told the telegraph .	-3.5249
The course , which is being offered for the first time this year , explains students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their overall well-being .	-4.0912
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of University Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-3.9593
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.2618
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping room where students click on coffee cups , curtains , coaches and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeping time routine .	-5.2141
A further section explains how long sleep train can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression and cancer .	-3.8395
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their everyday lives .	-2.8313
We know that it will not change student behaviour immediately .	-2.3658
" But we believe that they have a right - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " said Prof. Czeisler .	-3.2854
The culture of pride to go through a " night " still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on pupils and students makes sleep train a growing problem .	-4.7808
Having enough sleep of good quality , should be the " secret weapon " of a student to fight stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - not to increase either , because sleep tension puts the brain in starvation mode and makes it hungry .	-6.3509
Raymond Sun , a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes in Harvard last year .	-3.0753
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus course .	-2.1784
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all doctoral candidates to complete a similar study program before entering the Competition University .	-4.3477
Prof. Czeisler advised students to alert when they should go into bed and wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can disrupt their circadian rhythm , leading to problems of sleeping .	-5.9204
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal Earth Gerrard 's Men	-2.1135
Further foreign problems of the Rangers : after a hit by Dolly Menga , Livingston defeated 1-to-0 for the uncertain team of Steven Gerrard .	-5.9749
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since February 4 : 1 triumph in St. Johnstone , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard 's second defeat in 18 games as a coach , leaving his team eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroke Premiership Chief Hearts .	-12.6048
Menga ended a hit seven minutes before the middle time , and an inspirational ranger layout did not look like she could compensate .	-6.0428
While the rangers now fall to sixth place , Livingston climbs to rank three and lies behind Hibernian only because of the gateway difference .	-5.1986
New difficulties for the rangers are apparent , as the regular judge Calum Spence had to provide a headwound after being hit by a litter – apparently thrown out by the foreign fans sector .	-7.2887
Gerrard made eight shifts , passing Ayr and swept directly into the semi-final of the Betfred Cup .	-4.5153
Holt , on the other hand , set the same Livi Elf that took the Hearts one point last week , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team never allowed the opponents to take action .	-7.2490
The rangers dominated ball ownership , but Livingston did better implement opportunities .	-5.0701
They should have met after only two minutes when Mengas ’ s first officer sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor ’ s gate , but the midfield player passed his big change at the gate .	-5.8756
A deep blow of Keaghan Jacobs then went to Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far behind the post .	-4.1486
The rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than veretrage in their own game , the last third .	-3.4500
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he had earned a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided , but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not respond to the Colombian appeals .	-4.8187
The Rangers arrive only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly able to get out of silence by Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and the hit of a bitter Ovie Ejaria .	-6.1385
Although Livis 's 34th minute opening match may have been contrary to the course of the game , nobody can deny that they deserve it for their efforts alone .	-4.7058
Again , the rangers failed to master a standard Jacobs situation .	-2.7588
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball , keeping the calm and picking out Menga for a simple finish .	-3.5138
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-4.2242
But Livingston continued to attract the guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett swearing long balls after long balls . .	-4.9495
Holt ’ s team could have expanded their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood up well to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow left the corner .	-4.1446
Rangers ’ representative Glenn Middleton had another belated claim to a punishment because he devastated himself with Jacobs , but once again he looked thomson away .	-13.4700
Almanach : Inventor of Vigin Counter	-2.7791
And now a page from our almanac “ Sunday morning ” : September 30 , 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , violin , was born in Germany .	-11.3378
Geiger developed a method for recognizing and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as a violinist .	-4.8963
The violinist has since become a mainstate of science , as in the 1950s of the movie " Bells of Coronado " , which appears to be unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-4.6870
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.0859
Rogers : “ It is a violinist who is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium .	-2.4447
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-3.2425
Evans : “ Tell us , but now it cracks massively ! ”	-3.8170
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.9250
But the invention that bears its name is still used .	-2.4164
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” evil cells .	-6.4630
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells .	-7.6077
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment .	-2.1253
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of this in the laboratory .	-3.7634
You can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again .	-3.6036
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers .	-2.2389
A woman treated with the vaccine teaching the immune system to detect rogue cells saw her ovary cancer disappearing for more than 18 months .	-2.7801
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , to change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many cancers , and then re-injecting cells .	-4.1684
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . '	-2.1709
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer ” , including breast , ovary , lung and colorectal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.5604
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating some kind of leukaemia .	-3.2497
After his appearance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with MAGA cap , left a pro-trump tirade from the stack .	-4.1175
It did not run well well .	-9.7565
Kanye West was bought out in the studio during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an excessive speech in which he praised the US . President Donald Trump said he would take place in 2020 .	-5.7235
After performing his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while carrying a Make America Great cap , he fought against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-3.7528
" As often as I speak to a white person , she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-2.5660
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been drawn from America a long time ago , " he said .	-3.0099
The Saturday Night-Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood Star Matt Damon made fun about Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement to the Senate ’ s Justice Committee about Christine Blasey Ford ’ s allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually killed her .	-4.7331
Although it was not broadcast , the film material was shared by the comedian Chris Rock in the Social Media by West ’ s slaughter .	-5.7091
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to mock West with the contribution .	-3.6999
West , too , had complained to the audience that it had been hard behind the stage , because of its head cover .	-5.2998
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.7018
You said : ' Do not go out with your hat ' .	-3.3444
You annoyed me !	-1.8579
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington examiner .	-2.6000
West continued : " Want to see the sunken place ? " said that he would " attract my superman cloak , because that means you can 't tell me what to do , you want the world to move forward ?	-5.0278
Try it with love . ”	-1.3215
His comments were received by the audience at least twice , and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to have moved , Variety reported , and quoted a person in the words , “ The whole studio was deadly . ”	-5.4462
West was substituted for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-3.6856
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , disguised as Perrier Bottle .	-2.8161
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who twittered : " This is for one of the most courageous spirits : THAT THE MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . "	-4.1229
But talkmaster Karen Hunter twittered that West is simply " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-2.7116
“ But I will not reward anyone ( buying his music or clothing or supporting his art ) , of which I believe he accepts and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-3.7615
He is free .	-0.9125
We also ' added it .	-2.1803
Before the show , the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now called “ the being formally known as Kanye West ” .	-3.2838
He is not the first artist to change her name and enters the footsteps of Diddy , also known as Puff Daddy , Puffy and P Diddy .	-2.6465
Mitrapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and , of course , the later music legend Prince , changed his name into a symbol and then the artist who used to be known as Prince .	-4.0051

Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters .	-2.9106
He continues : What is born and what is taught ?	-2.0706
What is taught on television and on the street gives the young boy the feeling that they must have this particular side of the man ?	-3.3962
I think this is really one of the great issues in our time – how can we change that ?	-4.0174
For young men , something has obviously gone wrong .	-2.9191

According to the information published , the private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , as well as US Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both of whom come from Utah , were .	-4.0754
The information appeared online on Thursday , posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate on accusations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.7644
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the Kavanaugh survey .	-2.1956
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of a Waters employee , Hill .	-4.3017
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continues .	-3.1787
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for leaking this information .	-3.5606
This stubborn claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.3360
Water ’ s statement quickly led to criticism online , including by the former White House Secretary Ari Fleischer .	-4.0171
“ The denial of the matter is extremely annoying , ” he wr.	-3.8458
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a Congress member .	-3.3267
If someone is accused of doing something , he cannot be evil .	-8.2762
They must not be offensive .	-2.9857
You must not question the plaintiff 's motives .	-2.5522
They must be calm and calm ” .	-2.9994
Fleischer seemed to compare Water ’ s response to Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused of being angry by critics during the hearing on Thursday .	-3.5327
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who runs alongside the seatless Water in the mid-term elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-5.0821
“ Big , if true , ” he went .	-3.1558
In her statement , Waters said that their office ' has informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of fraudulent claims .	-3.4476

Review of " Johnny English – You live only three times " – Badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.8348
It is a tradition to look for Brexit hints in every new movie with a British tendency , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy Spoof franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-established in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-16.8827
Is ironic self-satire about the abyss of humanity the nation ’ s new export capacity ?	-4.0094
In any case , the gloomy , rubber-like and incompetent Johnny English has for the second time been licensed to remass things .	-6.7000
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour , has received a little clouseau , a splasher Mr. Bean and a klacks from this guy , who has contributed a single note to the flagship melody of the fire fighters at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012 .	-6.8654
It is also based on travellers and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once played a part in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads , always leaving chaos .	-4.9237
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.6799
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and beats the main rotor briefly against his helmet .	-3.4998
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially as the " serious " film brands such as 007 and mission impossible offer comedy as ingredients .	-4.3247
The humor feels like being directed to children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson 's Mr. Bean mute films .	-4.5715
The ever-increasing premise is that Britain is in great trouble .	-2.7500
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground to horror the service agent – an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.4539
Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-teresa May figure , but there is not much in the script to work with .	-3.9997
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as each and every active spy has been compromised , it must bring someone out of retirement .	-4.1829
And that means the fantastic Johnny English himself , who is now a school master in a noble establishment , but gives unsurpassed lessons on how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy on Spionage .	-6.0860
Deutsch is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering friend Bough , who is again played by Ben Miller .	-4.4566
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , a tireless burschikose role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not entirely valid .	-4.3909
So , the Batman and Robin of Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenkos beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-10.0135
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is risky in the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire , who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-4.3700
English and Bough begin their odyssey of colourful Highjinks : as a waiter dressed , they ignite a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas House .	-5.8266
For this last sequence , all the registers have certainly been drawn , but as lovingly and abandoned as it is , the whole thing is pretty reminiscent of children 's television .	-6.4507
Quite moderate .	-2.0597
And , as with the other Johnny English movies , I could not fail to think : Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.9956
Labour denies to have developed a plan for Britons for a four-day week for which five days are paid .	-3.4940
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan in which Britons work only four days a week , but are paid for five .	-3.1499
According to reports , the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the Artificial Intelligence Revolution ( AI ) to workers by giving them an additional day .	-4.2907
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money home .	-2.7605
Sources said that the idea would " fit " with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tip the country for the benefit of workers .	-4.0920
The trade union congress approved the transition to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to exploit the changing economy .	-3.8171
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.7577
A four-day week is an objective that is consistent with the party ’ s approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and the party ’ s overall industrial strategy , but that objective will not be realized overnight .	-4.8804
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 campaign .	-2.3503
However , the entire Labour Party does not support this move .	-4.2315
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not party politics and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.8863
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to concretize his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.8446
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit-makers ' in utilities .	-2.7377
The Shadow Chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not receive their entire share back , as a Labour government could " deduct " on the basis of alleged misconduct .	-6.0222
He also confirmed the plans to appoint employees in the management and to create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of private-sector equity to employees receiving annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-5.3361
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their minds .	-2.9482
Following an ongoing FBI investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote on the appointment of the judge to the Supreme Court has been postponed by at least a week , and the question is raised as to whether the FBI ’ s findings could cause Republican senators to give up their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.4891
In an interview broadcast on Sunday , Scott Pelley , the “ 60 minute correspondent , ” asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s findings could encourage them to change their mind .	-4.1428
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.5719
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.6592
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.7995
I called him after that happened after this claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-4.2185
He was determined , targeted , unambiguous . '	-2.1538
Graham 's voice , however , seemed to be cast in stone .	-2.8766
" I have an opinion on board Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb accusation , " he said .	-3.0776
" Dr. Ford , I do not know what happened , but I know that Brett has vehemently disputed the accusation , " Graham added a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-12.8502
" No one she called could confirm it .	-2.8869
It was 36 years ago .	-1.1439
I do not see anything new that is changing . '	-2.4189
'What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it ensured that poverty is reduced ? '	-1.8257
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-11.2063
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event : ending extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.1373
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it .	-2.9302
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event , the concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteering , e-mail to a guide in the world , telephone calls or other useful ways to increase the target of poverty reduction and raise awareness of it .	-6.5348
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.1243
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way of convincing people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel as if they were making a real difference by signing an online petition or an online petition or by sending a tweet ?	-5.0947
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters , pushing for a variety of goals .	-3.0165
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-3.1918
In early 2018 , the Group launched 390 bets and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid out or financed .	-3.5752
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world .	-3.4153
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK based partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to help Rwanda with $ 35 million to end malnutrition in the country after Global Citizens have received more than 4,700 tweets .	-4.8434
“ With the support of the British Government , donors , other state governments , and global citizans like you , we can make the social injustice of malnutrition one day history , ” The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.9000
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom , aimed at improving the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will reach the funding of the Power of Nutrition project of 5 million women and children with nutritional intervention .	-4.8082
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.6435
Global citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.8580
Like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-3.2581
will feature stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe at this year 's New York event , which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-3.5835
Using the Navy , the US could build a “ blockade ” to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Minister – to hinder Russia ’ s energy exports .	-4.7790
Washington can use his navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-9.4736
Zinke argued that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria was a pretext for exploring new energy markets , especially in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government .	-4.0684
“ I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the following : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-9.4019
And , according to officials , there are ways and means to bypass it .	-3.2387
" The United States has this ability to work with our navy to ensure that the sea routes are open and , if necessary , to block them to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-4.9329
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.6596
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are actually the same . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-12.9378
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a " one-trick pony " with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy .	-2.8748
Opinions come , while the Trump administration was on the mission of boosting exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replacing Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-4.3726
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to get Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin a “ prisoner . ”	-3.8921
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11-billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline , which is intended to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-3.1792
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.5063
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.5884
The attitude of the United States has given rise to a backlash from Germany , which has confirmed its commitment to the project .	-6.7650
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.4537
" I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply , " said the Federal Association of German Industry ( BDI ) , Dieter Kempf , after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-2.9556

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider the candidacy for the presidency after the mid-term elections .	-2.3683
During a Council meeting in Holyoke , Massachusetts , Warren confirmed that she would consider running .	-1.6237

Warren burdened President Donald Trump during the Rauhaus meeting , saying that he is " leading that country in the wrong direction . "	-4.6257
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.7665
Warren ’ s criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court of Justice has not taken Brett Kavanaugh ’ s leaf to his mouth .	-4.8004
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-2.3891
But a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-2.6368
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 % of the " likely " Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not stand .	-2.6795
Thirty-two per cent supported such a course .	-1.7686
The survey showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick , with 38 % for a potential run and 48 % against .	-2.9599
Other high-profile democrats discussed with a view to a possible candidacy in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders .	-3.3203

He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence on Monday evening .	-2.5391
“ Against the background of what my own son is going through , what he is going through just after he returns , I can understand other families feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries with which our soldiers return , ” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa , Oklahoma .	-4.7739
Palin described his arrest as “ the elephant in the room , ” and said about her son and other veterans : “ They come back a little differently ; they come back harder , wondering whether the work of their co-soldiers and the air force , and all the other members of the military , is respected for the country . . ” . , . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.1449

18 states and Washington , DC support a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to the victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-3.0592
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district in Washington on Friday submitted an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) to assist an asylum seeker in contesting the law .	-4.2236
The full name of the plaintiff in the legal dispute against sessions submitted in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Law is not known .	-3.3376

She was arrested in Texas .	-0.7939
The federal lawyers who support Grace called El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which encompass a large number of asylum seekers in the US , nations that are facing deep problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-4.4062
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision by the 2014 Chamber of Appeals for Immigrants that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for as.	-4.4084
The Minister of Justice of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-2.9672
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all asylum applications must be judged according to the circumstances of the respective complaint and that such action violates this principle .	-4.8331
Lawyers further argued in the letter that the politics that refuses entry to immigrants damages the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and do “ necessary work . ”	-3.9565
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to persons fleeing domestic or gang power .	-3.6153
“ Asylum is for those who have to leave their home country for persecution on grounds of race , religion , nationality or belonging to a particular social group or on grounds of political opinion , ” said Sessions in his declaration on the law on 11 June .	-5.3838
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems , even the serious ones that people face every day around the world .	-3.9867

US ambassadors accuse China of “ bullying ” with “ propaganda advertising ”	-2.4316
A week after an official Chinese newspaper made a four-sided ad in a US newspaper on the mutual benefit of US China trade , the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda .	-5.1417
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid insert of China Daily in the Des Moine Register , the state with the most sold newspaper in Iowa , after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US Congress elections , which China denies .	-4.8700
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US elections is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.1058
While it is normal for foreign states to place advertisements to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.6235
At an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliation tariffs were supposed to meet exporters in US states like Iowa , where many Trump ’ s Republican Party supporters live .	-3.6512
Terry Branstad , US ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing injured American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.2567
China , Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ This bullying is now firmly pursuing through propaganda ads in our own free press .	-4.9794
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moine Register , China ’ s government is taking advantage of the esteemed American tradition of freedom of expression and press , ” wrote Branstad .	-4.1508
" By contrast , at the newspaper booth in the streets of Beijing , you will find only limited differing voices , and you will not see a real reflection of differences of opinion that the Chinese people might have about China ’ s worrying economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-6.3082
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers contradicted the offer of publication " , although he did not say which newspaper .	-2.7577
Republicans rub voters before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle , warn analysts to warn analysts about the midterm . .	-10.5990
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee who is elected to the Supreme Court , despite being accused of sexual assaults , and analysts warn that they will see a counterattack in the forthcoming elections , especially women .	-4.8866
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-3.2453
These things cannot be returned , said Grant Reeher , Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-2.1317
Reeher said he doubted that last minute support from Jeff Flake ( Republican MP for the state of Arizona ) for FBI investigations is sufficient to reconcile angry voters .	-3.8536
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor will they forget it in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.3692
On Friday morning , the demonstrators sung : “ November comes ! ” while demonstrating in the corridor of the Senate , when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , reported Mic .	-4.2141
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalist .	-1.6653
“ People say that it is already quite advanced , that is true .	-3.8363
But the figure could be higher , especially among suburban and younger voters , 18 to 29 , who may not suffer the president but often do not vote . ”	-4.4214
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she made her accusations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans push ahead with candidacy .	-4.8463
“ This has become a confusing chaos for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , at the beginning of last week , according to NBC News .	-2.8721
“ It ’ s not just about the committee election or the final election , or whether Kavanaugh is put on the replacement bank , it ’ s about how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it , ” said Guy Cecil , director of US priorities , a group that helps elect Democrats , told the news channel .	-5.8941
But the Americans are divided on Ford and Kavanaugh ’ s statements .	-3.0325
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of respondents Ford definitely or probably believed testimony , while 35 % indicated that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh .	-3.8347
Moreover , 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 percent said the same about Ford .	-3.2375
At the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and of at least one other prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.6557
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her drunk at the age of 17 .	-2.8459
Ramirez accuses nominees of having dismayed his genitals before her during her studies in Yale in the 1980s .	-5.0155
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook .	-2.3022
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , is founding a startup company to compete with Facebook , Amazon and Google .	-3.1345

Solid allows users to specify where their data is stored and which people may access what information .	-4.3789
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt ’ s goal was to take over world rule .	-3.4134
“ We must do it now , ” he said about the startup .	-2.3573
“ It is a historic moment . ”	-1.2546
The App uses Solid technology to help users create their own personal data storage device or POD .	-3.9377
Data storage can contain contact lists , tasks , calendars , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-3.1802
It is like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Slack and Spotify all available on a browser and all at the same time .	-2.1282
The special feature of personal online storage is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information is possible .	-4.8001
The company calls it “ empowering people through data . ”	-3.3375
According to the CEO of John Bruce , Inrupt will provide resources , processes and corresponding know-how to make solid accessible to a broad user base .	-3.7431
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform acquired by IBM , some employees involved in the project and a community of voluntary programmers .	-2.8851
From this week , technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website .	-3.6127
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor he himself will talk to Facebook and Google about the comprehensive changes that will put all previous business models on the head overnight .	-4.1538
“ We will not ask them for permission ” .	-2.2729
In an article on Medium published on Saturday , Berners-Lee wrote that Inrits ' mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web . '	-2.9164
In 1994 , Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .	-1.9715

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-1.8678
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling of being subdued to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-4.7309
The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware at the secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.4525
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said he had spoken publicly about the rights of gay people to give other “ hope . ”	-3.4429
He also said that victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.6122
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has been released for several months due to a disease .	-3.0692
Daley appeared in Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” as an adult than the others , because “ society did not accept standing on men and women . ”	-4.5269
He said : “ To date , these feelings of less value and difference have given me the strength and strength I needed to succeed . ”	-4.2521
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , in order not to disappoint anyone when he was guided by his sexual orientation .	-3.9774
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year 's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-3.8419
He said he was pronounced because he was lucky enough to be able to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give other ' hope ' .	-4.4418
The triple world champion said that he fell in love with a man , the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , which he was very surprised about .	-3.5537
Daley married the Oscar winner , 20 years older than him , last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-3.7090
“ If you go through so much in so young years , ” he first attended the Olympic Games at the age of 14 , three years later his father died of cancer , whether it was hard for him to find someone at the same age who experienced similar high and low levels .	-6.1808
The couple was in June parents of a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley , and Daley said his " whole perspective " has changed .	-2.0640
“ Last year , for me , everything was about winning a gold medal , ” he said .	-3.0275
" But you know what , there are more important than Olympic gold .	-2.7010
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.7409
His son bears the name of his father Robert , who died in 2011 at only 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-3.0767
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether she had her tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.1484
“ I couldn ’ t tell him : <unk> You won ’ t experience sitting in the first row , Dad <unk> , ” he said .	-4.2788

The weak Mickelson sat at the bank on Ryder Cup Saturday .	-4.4525
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he must drastically improve his shape so that it does not become a sad milestone .	-3.7762
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday .	-4.1758
Rather than being at the heart of the event , as is often the case for the US , the five-fold Major winner divided his day between fires and practice rounds in the golf course , hoping to overcome his depth .	-5.7403
The 48-year-old is never the most straightforward driver even at the peak of his career and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-4.1779
And as if the place alone were not challenging enough , Mickelson meets on Sunday in the ninth match on Sunday the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-5.3680
If Americans lag four points at the start of the 12 single games and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-4.2107
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband ; what was left to him also .	-3.5683
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-2.9336
" He has a lot of self-confidence .	-2.0657
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-1.8608
I probably didn 't think he was playing two games .	-3.1496
I had wished for more , but it has now come to pass , and that is the way we have had to tackle it .	-6.3535
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-2.1392
Until now , Nick Faldo is holding the record of most matches played at the Ryder Cup , which Mickelson on Sunday .	-6.0059
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully matched the heights of his individual record .	-3.7418
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times in a draw , while Furyk said that his presence would have been invaluable to the team .	-4.1536
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves entertaining people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.0993

It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.7375
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can soon disappear .	-2.8185
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup can quickly become an inconvenient knit .	-5.6729
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points vis-à-vis the Americans , but only scarcely crossed the finish line and won with a thin leap of $ 14 to $ 13 .	-5.8691
" It is remembered that one was in the leadership of Valderrama ; we had a great lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but only scarce , " said Bjorn , after seeing the class of 2018 , now leading with 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-6.3296
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.5765
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-2.6635
Go out and do the right things .	-1.6608
It is only over when the points are displayed on the table .	-3.7661
Our goal is to win this cup , and that is what we focus on .	-3.1695
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.8080
Enthusiastic how his players played in a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be too fast .	-4.4874
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.9459
Tomorrow are the personal appearances , and that is another thing .	-2.8994
It is great to be out there with a partner if things go well , but if you are out there alone , then your own skills as a golf player are tested on the whole .	-5.6233
This is the message you have to convey to the players : get the best out of it tomorrow .	-4.3228
Now you hand over to your partner , and he must make every effort just like you . ”	-5.8790
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive to make his players perform better individually than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have won three out of four points .	-4.5336
Furyk himself has already experienced such a sensational change at the end of the day , when he was part of the winning team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team accomplished the “ Miracle of Medinah ” . in in . in . in . . in . . . in . .	-13.0256
" I remember every condemned word , " he said about how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on his way to the last day .	-3.8250
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to get started as soon as possible , as you saw in Brookline , Medinah .	-4.5246
Once a dynamic has developed , the pressure on the middle matches is exerted .	-5.4730
We have built up our list accordingly and brought the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-5.0103
Together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , the other European in the top rankings , Thomas should lead the fight against Rory McIlroy in the top game .	-4.0187
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-3.0613
Re-schedule postponement of Germany ’ s New War Ship	-3.4607
The German Navy ’ s newest frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the Cold War warships that have come into existence for years , but it will now take at least until next year , owing to flawed systems and escalating costs .	-7.0867
The launch of the “ Rheinland-Palatinate ” , the flagship of the Baden-Württemberg class ’ s brand new frigates , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , calling on a military spokesman .	-9.5680
The navy should have commissioned ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery burdened the ambitious project .	-3.7416
The four fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-3.5722
It is assumed that they have a powerful gun , a series of anti-air and ship defence missiles , and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.5154
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the newest frigates are supposed to be operational for up to two years without going to the home port .	-5.7421
However , the state-of-the-art warships , which are intended to allow Germany to project power overseas , will already be outdated by the constant delays when they are finally put into service , as the weekly newspaper “ The Time ” notes .	-6.2065
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year , when the German navy officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg .	-3.7254
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a shipbuilding company after delivery .	-3.3528
Little was known about the reasons for the return of ships ; German media mentioned a number of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the warship useless in combat operations .	-4.4462
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships are served by a crew of around 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older frigates of the Bremen class .	-4.2980
It also turned out that the ship has a considerable overweight , which would limit the performance and make future upgrades difficult for the navy .	-5.3469
It is assumed that the 7,000-tonne Rhineland Palatinate is twice as heavy as ships of the same class used by Germans in the Second World War .	-3.9411
In addition to faulty hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also discussed .	-4.7050
Instead of the initially estimated EUR 2.2 billion , the cost now seems to have reached the dizzying amount of EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-4.3433
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power is diminishing .	-4.6790
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , admitted that the war fleet actually “ runs out of operational ships . ”	-3.8835
The official said that the problem had grown avalanche over time , as old vessels were dismissed without replacing them .	-5.3331
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates were put into service by the navy .	-2.8167
The National Trust illustrates the secret life of bats .	-2.0200
New research on a estate in the Scottish Highlands try to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-3.7692
It is hoped that this will bring new insights into the behaviour of the unique flying mammals , which can provide guidance for future measures to protect animals .	-4.6481
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pepper trees as well as brown lengthy and durable bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross .	-5.3777
Special recording devices are placed at the main points of the accommodation to monitor bat mouse activities throughout the season .	-3.9163
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with hand detectors .	-2.0109
An expert audio analysis of all pictures determines the frequency of bat calls and assigns the call to species .	-5.0039
The habitat card and the corresponding report should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-11.9766
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) Nature Conservation Advisor , hopes to find out which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species .	-4.9133
This information will help to identify the advantages of habitat management , how to best preserve meadows and forests for bats and other related species .	-4.0307
The bat mouse populations in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined sharply over the last hundred years .	-3.9569
They are threatened by construction work that affects their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-3.4272
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk , as well as fly catchers ' strips and some chemical treatments of building materials , att. . . . . . . . . . . , . , . ,	-12.9239
Bats are not really blind .	-1.8924
Adapted to their nightly hunting activities , the ears are more useful than the eyes when catching prey .	-5.6475
They use sophisticated echo location technology to locate errors and obstacles in their flight path .	-4.2578
The NTS , which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes bats very seriously .	-3.1800
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys , inspect sleeping places and sometimes carry out rescues .	-3.6025
The organization has even established Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Threade estate in Dumfries and Galloway , home to eight of the ten Scottish bat species .	-3.8522
According to David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.2630
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.5029
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.2664
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we are doing here and on other land helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.3521
It stresses that it is important to check , before maintenance work in buildings , whether bats are there , according to which it is possible that up to 400 females and boys may die when a single sleeping place is unintentionally destroyed – a whole local population may be extinguished .	-7.1534
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-2.9848
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish Bat Conservation Trust employee , has encouraged the public to help .	-2.1137
She said : “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species , we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.9854
Ronaldo denies rape claims when lawyers sue the German magazine .	-3.1575
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-2.6885
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which has published the accusations .	-9.3959
The storm from Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-2.1873
He was said to have paid $ 375,000 to keep quiet about the incident , Der Spiegel reported on Friday .	-3.6550
Hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo rejected 33 in an instagram live video to his 142 million followers the reports as “ fake news . ”	-2.9458
No , no , no , no , no .	-0.8310
What they say today , fake news , ” said the fifth balloon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-2.5331
" They want to apply for themselves by using my name .	-2.1338
“ That is normal .	-1.5172
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.4457
I am a happy person , and everything is good , ” the player added smiling .	-3.0923
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ inadmissible reporting on suspicions in the field of privacy . ”	-4.8514
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for “ intangible damage equal to the severity of the injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years . ”	-3.7467
The alleged incident is due to occur in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.2679
According to documentation submitted to the Clark County District Court in the US state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga retired to the player 's room after getting to know them in a nightclub where he raped them anal .	-5.3915
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “ a 99 % ” a “ good guy ” who was abandoned by the “ 1 % . ”	-5.3191
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-1.8617
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had " fear of retaliation " and worried about " becoming humiliated publicly . "	-4.9636
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to invalidate the agreement because it remains traumatized by the alleged incident .	-3.1510
Ronaldo was on the brink of his move to Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and changed to the Italian giant Juve this summer with a € 100 million deal .	-4.9287
Brexit : Britain would forever regret losing car manufacturers	-1.9264
“ The UK would regret it for a lifetime if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading automobile manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economic Minister Greg Clark .	-4.1131
He added that it was " worrying " that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily cease production in their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.4570
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-1.3115
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.1398
The Burnaston plant , which manufactures the Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-2.7441
“ If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I think it will stop production at our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO at Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.4302
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-3.1039
BMW , for example , has already announced that it will close its plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit .	-2.7958
The most important concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.0518
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on demand oriented production , i.e. the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the UK and the EU for custom made products .	-4.9836
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border , which , according to industry information , can lead to supply shortages and partial shortages .	-4.2670
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day of stock in his plant in Derbyshire , the company said , and so would stop production will be stopped .	-3.5594
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU was “ exactly calibrated to avoid these border controls . ”	-2.8353
We must have a deal ; we want the best deal that not only enables us to succeed today , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said the BBC Radio 4 programme today .	-5.1642
“ The reference not only from Toyota , but also from other manufacturers , is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.6647
Toyota did not indicate how long the production stopover could take , but warned that the cost increase could in the long run affect the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs .	-6.2548
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives and employed in Burnaston for 24 years , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ In my experience , once they have been dismantled , jobs are lost forever . ”	-4.7254
A spokesman said : ' We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-3.3087
The Trump Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again , says the White House	-10.2548
Donald Trump ’ s high-profile meeting with Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be “ postponed another week , ” as the battle for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House said on Sunday .	-4.7489
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russia ’ s election intervention , Trump ’ s ties with Russia , and the President ’ s possible obstruction of justice .	-4.7906
Whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Public Prosecutor , and to jeopardise Müller ’ s independence , Washington has gained a great deal of tragedy for months .	-5.0331
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president of the 25th constitutional amendment .	-3.6139
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.4083
But last Monday he went to the White House , while there were reports that he was about to resign .	-4.0395
Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .	-2.2687
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the sitting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Justice Committee hearing that Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-3.6675
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh , and continued to delay a full senate vote .	-4.1371
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-2.4779
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : " A date for this has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I was postponing another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-5.5997
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-3.0048
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.8453
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.1929
Sanders said that the shortage of briefings was not due to a reluctance to television reporters who behave like self-actors , but she also said : ' I will not be against them being in the gallery ' .	-5.3996
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.6117
" The President does more questions and answers than any president before him , " she said and added , without any evidence , " We have looked at these figures . "	-4.6117
Briefings will still take place , Sanders said , but if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly , that is infinitely better than talking to her .	-4.0173
We are trying to do a lot of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press discussion if you can talk to the President of the United States himself . ”	-4.4069
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.1818
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.1336
In New York this week , the president perhaps showed why by making a free-flowing and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-11.0429

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax rate when buying property in the UK - the extra money will be used for homeless , Theresa May announces today .	-3.9504
This move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn ’ s efforts to attract young voters with promises , offer more affordable housing , and seek high incomes .	-3.3980
The stamp fee is levied on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK , and the extra money will help the government to combat homelessness .	-3.9676

Numerous wealthy regions of the country , especially the capital , have become “ ghost towns , ” as many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country .	-3.6150
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a stamp tax section to help more young people possess their first home .	-3.5261
He accused large construction firms of keeping housing prices high by purchasing land cheaply but not cultivating it , and asked Mrs May to abolish affordable housing quotas to end housing misery in Britain .	-5.8647
Mr Corbyn has announced a concise set of proposed housing reforms , including rental controls and an end to indebted-independent settlements .	-4.2535
He also wants to give the Councils more powers to build new houses .	-2.3292
Mrs May said : ‘ Last year I said that I dedicated my premiere to the revival of the British dream – life should be better for every new generation .	-3.3852
And that means putting our broken housing market in order .	-2.1359
Britain will always be open to people who want to live , work and build a life .	-3.0971
However , it cannot be right for foreign companies and people who do not live in the UK to buy homes just as easily as for hard-working British citizens .	-4.2066

" But I have often observed Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child , and it is always something that has brought me back .	-9.7704
" But this opportunity would only come if I succeeded in managing the club . "	-7.2426

The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to walk in the footsteps of these established managers in such a large club , previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town .	-4.9660
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this association back to the Premier League ? "	-3.3979
With its structure and facilities , this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League , ” he said .	-3.2128
" Creating it there is no easy task , but I would probably only consider myself successful if I could bring the club back there . "	-4.8323
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a co-trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-4.9208
He then helped Alloa recover from the Relegation to the third class , and helped St. Mirren from the margins of the Relegation to the master title in the following season .	-5.0872
Ross also says that during his career at Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academical he never felt as comfortable as now .	-3.2679
" It was probably a real crossroads , " he remembered when he took over the leadership of Alloa .	-2.8298

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for the struggling British pubs , but has increased pressure on the restaurant chains .	-3.9306
Pub and bar groups experienced a sales plus of 2.7 percent in July , but revenues in restaurants fell 4.8 percent , according to the figures .	-4.3281
Peter Martin , from the CGA consultancy that compiled the figures , said : " Sustainable sunshine and England longer than expected permanent participation in the World Cup led July to a similar pattern as last June , when pub visits rose by 2.8 % , only that the restaurants were even more affected .	-6.2236
The 1.8 % decline in the gastronomy business in June only worsened in July .	-3.3831
Drink-dominated pubs and bars were by far the strongest , with Like-for-Like numbers rising more than the restaurants fell .	-13.1104
The pubs dominated by foodstuffs also suffered under the sun , albeit not as dramatic as restaurant operators .	-4.1526
It seems that people just wanted to have a drink .	-2.9523
In managed pubs and bars , sales for drinks increased by 6.6 % this month , while food fell by 3 % . "	-3.7179
Paul Newman , an RSM analyst for leisure and hospitality , said : " These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April .	-3.1194
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling in the out-of-home market . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-13.4907
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to be under pressure , although a 4.8 % decline in revenue over the previous year will be particularly painful , alongside the ongoing cost pressures . .	-5.7618
The long hot summer could not have come for food operators at a worse time , and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide for the much-needed break .	-4.6800

Milk pump advertising , which compares mothers to cows , has led to controversial online discussions .	-2.9407
A dairy pump company has caused controversial online discussions , owing to an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with milk cows .	-4.4801
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " world 's first noiseless and portable milk pump " , the consumer-tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.7359
Four real mothers dance in a hat in the middle of cows to a number with the following song text : ' Yes , I melt , but you see no tail ' and ' if you didn 't notice that they are not euters , they are my breasts ' .	-5.5049
The slogan goes on : ' Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I milk my ladies ' .	-3.3400
However , the advertisement published on the facebook page of the company has caused controversy online .	-4.1961
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from spectators , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of dairy industry .	-3.3285
'It is a very bad decision to advertise cows for this product ' .	-2.2442
Like us , they too must become pregnant and bear to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days of their birth , " a person wrote .	-4.5592
The Elvie milk pump fits inconspicuously into a silent bra ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-3.4358
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.2786
Yes , why should we not promote with them a dairy pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-3.5829
Someone else added : ' Such an outsider acquisition ' .	-3.1804
Others defended advertising , including a woman who admitted that she found the song “ urcomic ” .	-2.9770
I think this is a great idea .	-1.5715
I would have received one if I had stopped .	-3.1379
By pumping , I felt like a cow .	-11.0915
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.1655
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-2.3586
Another comment : ' This is a funny advertising for mothers who pump ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like ' cows ' .	-4.0671
This is not advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry ' .	-2.9346
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they all danced with the discreet pumps in their bras .	-3.5854
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows .	-6.2416
However , the Elvie Pump is completely silent , has no wires or hoses and fits inexorably into a silent bra , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out at pumping .	-5.4235
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative market introduction .	-2.8628
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on the breast pump and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring with .	-4.0009

Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a camp on the Texan border .	-2.9889
The number of imprisoned migrant children rose , even though monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-4.3529
Traditionally , most sponsors have been self-undocumented immigrants , fearing that they will risk being expelled if they work for a child .	-4.6129
The risk increased in June , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to fingerprint and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-5.4901
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified to the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-2.8889
The agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-3.0507
" Almost 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or budgetary members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens .	-12.3619
" We continue to pursue these people , " said Albence .	-3.7193

Those who are not eligible for discharge will be delayed quickly .	-3.2246
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely they are to be frightened or depressed , which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape .	-3.4732
Proponents said that these concerns are being reinforced in a larger institution such as Tornillo , where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked because of its size .	-5.2466
They added that moving children to the tent town without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to leave friends could worsen a trauma with which many are already struggling .	-5.0381
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-2.1987
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the country ’ s war has been continuing for eight years .	-3.4555
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-4.5430
“ They must withdraw immediately unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.7517
Moualem strongly claimed that the “ war on terror is almost over in Syria . ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , and millions more have been driven out of their homes .	-4.0944
He said that Damascus will continue to “ fight this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence forces . ”	-3.0561
The US has around 2,000 troops in Syria ; mainly educate and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.5367
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-2.8758
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for return are fine , accusing “ some Western countries of irrational fears ” that led refugees to keep away .	-4.3949
“ We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return , ” says Moualem .	-2.2381
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-2.0498
The United States and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there can only be reconstruction aid for Syria if there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on an end to the war .	-3.9541
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold , Idlib , provides the opportunity to advance political talks .	-4.6747
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-2.7534
Moualem , however , stressed that the agreement lays down “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that military action will be directed against jihadists , including against fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al Qaeda , who will “ be extinguished . ” .	-5.9263
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-2.9512
Moualem called conditions for the Syrian government ’ s participation in the committee : he said that the body ’ s work should be limited to “ reviewing the articles from the current constitution , ” warning against interference .	-4.4237

But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador , which was estimated to receive $ 140 million in American aid in 2017 , including stun controls , development , and economic support .	-3.1142

Saipov , 30 , reportedly used a Home Depot rental car in October for his attack on a cycling path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan , where he tracked pedestrians and cyclists path .	-4.8188

Both charges can be charged with death , according to court documents .	-4.1431
