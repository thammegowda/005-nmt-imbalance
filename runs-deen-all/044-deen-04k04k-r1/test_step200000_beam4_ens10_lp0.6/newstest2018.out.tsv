Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your view of the city .	-3.1455
A mistaken institution where young people are to meet today .	-4.6603
A group chapel where now is digged for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-3.9538
Small gardeners manage the former farming grounds .	-4.0006
Munich ’ s oldest official map promotes exciting stories .	-2.6258
It annoys when maps are not up to date .	-2.9462
Everyone who has had to get excited about this , because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-6.6217
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer by the Bavarian Geoportal to the state government , are far from current - but this is precisely why they are very revealing .	-5.8391
Especially if you compare them with current online cards .	-3.0654
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the Munich Merkur spread since the 19th century .	-3.9376
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork that cannot be recognized as such .	-3.8457
The map includes more detailed maps , so-called Urposition Sheets , for cities and communities .	-5.4759
These were formed according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria .	-5.1700
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.4953
The French Army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War . in in in . in in in in in in in in in in in . in in . in in the in the in	-12.0925
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic admission of Bavaria - obviously for military purposes .	-3.4966
Although the French troops eventually withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , today ’ s neighbors created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map .	-4.6143
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to drive the project forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-4.2126
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian Landesbibliothek .	-5.4512
The comparison of the former / today is most impressive in the example of the capital of the country .	-5.5279
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-2.7747
An example of this is Untersendling , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map .	-3.7281
Sendling was declared a Munich district 21 years after the map was created in 1877 .	-4.2380
Today , Untersendling is in the middle of the city .	-3.5767
The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the current Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmers ' uprising against Austria in 1705 .	-4.2647
Where the West Park is today , you can see nothing as fields - at first sight : a smaller map with dozens of lines and figures appears when zooming in : handwritten numbered pieces of floorpieces from the so-called " premiere " from which the property tax was derived .	-8.1800
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the " Land in Sun " plant .	-5.1949
A large green area is located north of Untersendling .	-3.0554
The Theresienwiese , the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810 , was actually still a meadow in the nineteenth century - and not a concrete desert .	-4.1344
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.2684
In the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district , the Urpositionsblatt reads not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " On the air " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-5.8365
Yes , here at the Auerfeldstra<unk>e people were once blocked with madness .	-5.1851
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Regional Irrenanstalt " On der Auer Lüften " was established .	-6.6957
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - that psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II .	-4.8276
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chain of so-called mistakes .	-3.6034
He has also prohibited the staff from using violence against the passengers , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has worked on the institution for an exhibition .	-4.9118
There was room for 280 patients first , later extended to 500 places .	-4.5974
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular irrenal establishment in Haar 1905 .	-5.7690
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrics , has been located there .	-14.2047
Young people in the Munich Salesianum meet in the area of the former Auer Anstalt .	-4.3386
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training facilities .	-3.6484
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s .	-4.0512
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built , in an architectural style , on the origin of the Irren Institute , which had been destroyed during bombing during World War II .	-6.2888
The Marienplatz square was recorded around 1856 as " Hauptplatz " , the Kaufingerstra<unk>e was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.1458
The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-3.0071
In December 1944 , the Allied bombs torn many holes into the city centre .	-4.1524
A big remained to this day - at the Marienhof .	-3.5694
The English Institute , small business houses and a Middle Ages Gruftkapelle were once at the Marienhof , where preparatory work took place these days and on April 5 , 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn trail .	-7.2121
The slider allows you to compare the old Munich card with today 's aerial photo - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.2701
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-2.1745
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and the state ’ s racist attacks .	-4.3246
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travelling through the state and exercise extreme caution , as a number of questionable race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here , " says the Group 's opinion .	-6.5696
A recent law by Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to win discriminatory actions , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , which disproportionately target minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , said NAACP .	-5.6678
" They have violations of citizens ' rights , people happen .	-3.3349
They are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.5564
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . '	-2.7190
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US .	-2.5659
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.2474
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline during the trip through the state and was detained by the police of Missouri without being accused of crime .	-4.7257
The Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri , showing that black drivers in the state are 75 % more frequent than white .	-4.6500
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.9331
'People must be prepared to have deposit money or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state ' .	-11.0852
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime report , which ranked the state at the 16th rank in terms of the number of such violations .	-11.7212
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-10.8386
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for infringements of immigration , which ACLU believes will contribute to further race profiling .	-4.5338
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.6592
Pasture fence project is fundamental .	-7.2306
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year .	-2.3181
Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac , the CDU fellow members of Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac , have taken a picture on the spot .	-5.5389
At the right courtyard of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs .	-3.7931
Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and hosted holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.8812
" Black Forest milk " is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , according to Schwendemann .	-3.8543
On the table of the holiday guests is exclusively regional .	-5.0161
Since he is also Chairman of the BLHV of Fischerbach , he called the pasture fence project " fundamental " .	-4.0910
I cannot make profit on such steep areas .	-3.8139
The greenland area is a great deal of work and much needs to be done with the engine senses .	-7.3629
" We have here to fight with the conditions and topography , " said Schwendemann .	-3.6103
In 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not operate organic farming .	-5.3656
For mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is pleased about the leader promotion " .	-4.9278
At the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare , farmers should be supported .	-3.0887
It is hoped that this could take a long time to forestall the land .	-5.9872
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are worried about how to continue their business , " said the mayor .	-5.0103
Farmers are often criticised for the promotion of support .	-3.9777
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced into the grazing fence .	-4.0475
This means that the area of openness is 40 hectares , which cannot be reforested until at least 2023 .	-4.9246
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted via leader , a quarter wore the municipality of Fischerbach .	-4.7343
Thus , farmers have stayed at EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence .	-4.5625
" The great advantage is the durability of fences , " said Schwendemann .	-2.8479
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You do a good job , without farmers and farmers it is not possible " .	-4.4153
Peter Wei<unk> also said : " Best food is produced here " .	-4.2499
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote fences .	-3.5867
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.0302
A prerequisite is the existence of a promotional backdrop described by the LPR .	-5.1873
In addition , the fencing area must not be sloppy manageable ( slope exceeding 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation .	-5.6717
For the Fischerbach Weidezaunprojekt 2018 , the application is currently under way by eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.1144
The area of openness is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-4.3234
Is nothing more sacred ?	-7.8778
Now the White House of Trump is adopting the Statue of Liberty	-3.3131
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .	-2.5694
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other – hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein in the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-6.1875
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .	-4.0729
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.3462
A Horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have liked him to have done so .	-10.3479
But he attacked its importance , and especially the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base .	-3.8568
When Miller accused Acosta : " I don 't want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-4.4076
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom . '	-3.4411
Miller is factually right , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.0616
It is about contemporary resonance to Lazarus 's raging words , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your tired , your poor , your afflicted masses , who yearn to breathe freely / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-6.5700
There was never a time when the ' miserable waste ' was better visible on our screens .	-3.4485
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.5473
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-3.8393
Lazarus - and her friends , who were committed to putting their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they did a highly political act .	-5.0841
The sculpture was supposed to show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a weighted classical representation .	-5.1988
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-3.0761
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of exiles .	-3.5047
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.6208
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .	-3.4685
The great shepherd Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the overnight world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.1435
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.0709
The torch should not illuminate the path to the United States . '	-2.9310
Quite unusual , Limbaugh has found something here .	-11.5121
The importance of the statue is quite a matter of perception .	-3.3469
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-3.5465
The truth is to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.8681
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.8076
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-3.4389
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the path , but to ignite the hatred , which is its only source of power .	-9.8790
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK Team	-2.4322
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team .	-2.6600
The United Kingdom ’ s athletics director , Neil Black , says that the 16-member Scottish quota in the World Cup championship championship will make a massive contribution to the team .	-6.4261
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.1620
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and that the UK 's athletics must learn something from it .	-4.0677
" We welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find it , " said Black .	-3.0897
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5429
Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2861
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.1560
And also with the type of road corner .	-3.0527
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.8241
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team as a team captain .	-4.5565
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.5278
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.0994
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-2.9765
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally gave was great . '	-3.7510
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400m hurdles in their fifth World Championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.1280
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes in the World Cup has been seven , reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.1536
The medium-haul runner Muir is on this road and has set out five British and two European records last year .	-4.3468
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-2.4418
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot to watch after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.3971
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was .	-3.1156
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only belong to the team , but will in some cases also be involved in medals and finals .	-4.9714
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-5.1249
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.3445
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.7444
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on podiums .	-3.4908
With regard to my speech as a captain ?	-2.3871
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.3654
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .	-3.3512
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic stadium .	-11.1228
I have a second chance of going out and competing there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . '	-4.4869
Blocking critics on Facebook : Do not acquire a public office if you cannot tolerate voter heating .	-4.5040
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-2.0357
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-2.4730
He vaccinated in the critique , surely .	-3.5282
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.1091
After all , in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we are led to slaughter like sheep ' .	-4.3798
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.3547
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.9639
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week .	-2.1076
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Well , and ? " .	-9.8058
" It 's only Facebook " , many people said .	-2.4101
But it is important .	-0.7834
And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.5340
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular .	-1.8208
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.5949
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.1743
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .	-3.6747
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head for chemotherapy on his side .	-4.1097
Therefore , the blocking of people who come to the governor 's side - which is a public forum that is called official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.6025
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions and argued that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-3.1447
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the stick online .	-3.5481
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.0922
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a pastor , not a troll .	-3.1905
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profan .	-1.4456
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-2.2810
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hated , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.1160
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast " The Post " .	-3.5240
" Nor do I appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some people disregard it as a so-called collective effort and do not recognise it as a large group of citizens affected " .	-6.7050
What the governor ’ s staff called a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call “ advocacy . ”	-4.2110
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.1622
It is much cleaner than in the past if one had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-4.3027
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-2.3126
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for having accused Facebook and other social media .	-2.7727
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.8361
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .	-1.7597
The Chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-3.9914
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.2437
This should not be so difficult .	-1.7103
Currently Washington has had a similar effect on affordable postage as the Internet .	-3.7548
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters hit his leadership .	-3.2322
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.2378
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters to newspapers that depicted Washington 's decisions .	-3.1297
Petitions that criticised his position on the Amity Treaty , trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .	-3.5374
But he did not silence them .	-1.5055
Freedom of speech , difference of opinion and discourse form the basis of our nation .	-2.5502
And true leadership means accepting it .	-1.5376
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club .	-1.9401

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking	-1.8769
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.1105
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) will come to this conclusion in a study .	-3.8593
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year , " said Heiko Becher .	-3.3016
In comparison , he approached his own study on this subject from 1994 .	-4.0292
At that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .	-3.1437
The new investigation is published in the " International Journal of Public Health " .	-2.0071
House connections prove to be very complex .	-2.7713
The construction works in Villinger Stra<unk>e are in full swing and " are somewhat in time " , according to the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-4.8740
In the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , because there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not included in the plans .	-5.8743
The traffic that constantly hinders construction is a major problem for the Stumpp construction force .	-5.0423
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous , " says Heinze .	-4.4074

An existing movement that stirred up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta , which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it .	-3.8350

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.1290
But it is also Indonesia ’ s goldland .	-1.6964
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Paniai , a highlands province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.5182
In 2015 alone , Freeport , worth $ 3.1 billion , reduced gold and copper .	-2.5871
Moreover , Papua has an estimated $ 78 billion worth of wood resources .	-2.2329
But these wealth is a source of misery for the Papua , which ensures that Indonesia ’ s powerful military preserves a stifling presence .	-3.8232
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.0878

The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-2.8668

" Our hearts have broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , " said You .	-3.2674

On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-3.2153
The frightened children told them that they should turn their headlights on .	-2.4050
One of the soldiers took off their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-4.7208
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-2.9502
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.7654
A child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .	-3.0330
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was fired and things escalated the next day .	-2.7880
About 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .	-3.1137

Some protesters began to throw stones on police and military posts .	-3.5431
When the mood was heated up , the soldiers were sent an internal radio command : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " says an official TIME document that was not released to local media .	-4.6683
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for peace and invited the crowd to return home .	-3.5572
Nobody was listening to the mood .	-1.8165
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house .	-3.0568
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-2.9278
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-2.0515
The indigenous man Alfius Youw was met three times , according to his cousin , who witnessed the shoots . .	-3.3737

According to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and many more injured .	-2.1650
The news about the killings came ' filtered ' to Jakarta only the following day .	-2.9433
Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi made a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua .	-3.9515
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-3.0282
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations .	-2.6369
But the excuses almost immediately began .	-1.6756
" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-1.5059
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s .	-2.3736
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that need to be undertaken , " he said .	-3.5626
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.3769
Instead , " everything is regulated by law , " he said .	-1.9804
Wiranto , who accused the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody 1999 vote on independence , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved , including the Paniai incident .	-3.7928
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief .	-3.3047
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.8109

" After burying the bodies , the military searched for me , " he says .	-2.0564
The shootings did not stop .	-1.9868
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.7311
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man into the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-11.3744
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .	-3.2733
Current villagers protested at the company ’ s location office .	-4.2167
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.6415
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot on the crowd and killed one .	-1.8995
" We were so panicked , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here were quickly recovered , the TIME .	-4.5654
'I hid myself in my house two days ' .	-2.8151
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police to withdraw the mobile brigade from the area .	-3.6267
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian Government .	-2.2921
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of the tribal members of the Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.2207
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.1974
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-2.0256
In response , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years , on the pretext of " securing national sovereignty " .	-8.0112
Some never appear again .	-1.7712
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.8681
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.6160
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-2.7837
Bread is just as unreachable .	-2.2270
The people here are cultivating everything they eat : nota and fruit and vegetables .	-10.4661
Agriculture is the task of women , who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .	-4.1090
They retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . .	-3.7778
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.8116
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport .	-4.1166
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants .	-3.2668
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills needed to run their own companies competitively .	-4.0952
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council .	-3.1342
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.6678
Moreover , restrictions on reporting on international media remain tense .	-2.9533
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , even though they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.0058
According to Phelim Kine , Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development has not been realised .	-9.6266
" There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .	-3.3076
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely limited to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-3.1039
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai Shepherd .	-3.4392
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.5863
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Arrmanatha Nasir , rejected the group 's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-9.5940
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-8.8948
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and afflicted him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-4.2221
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi .	-2.3717
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , the Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-3.7235
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from living under the permanent threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor education and health services .	-2.7548
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must repay .	-3.0705
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.2394
Despite threats and intimidation , families of the Paniai shot victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance : the corpse of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .	-4.4011
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .	-3.4472

Fire captures the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time .	-3.3989
On Friday , a fire found its passage in one of the world ’ s highest towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee the 337-metre high 79-storey building .	-5.3972
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years , which is accidentally called the Torch Tower ( torch tower ) .	-5.1059
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.6190
" We slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the cry of people .	-4.3199
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " said a resident who gave his name as George , Reuters .	-3.7445
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at around 4.00 local time ( 00.00 GMT ) deleted the fire and cooled the building .	-4.8245
The government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected .	-2.9983
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world .	-3.8605
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the covering , the exterior covering came to decoration or isolation .	-5.1350

No Davis Cup reform : Continue Best-of-Five	-2.0559
The President of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-3.6513
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup-Single only on two winnings was hardly supported by the two-thirds majority required for this sport . . . . , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.6853
So the five-set classics , which are often very long , but also very valued , remain the traditional competition .	-6.4411
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of the reform , so the ITF President David Haggerty ’ s objective was scarcely missed .	-4.7674
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.7289
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.4127
We will continue to work to improve the application .	-2.9518
Following many objections , it was not until the vote that the proposal had been put to the vote that the final should be held in a neutral place .	-6.5258
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the next year .	-5.7533
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training courses and so on will be facilitated and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-5.9173
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travellers bring forbidden items into the aircraft , find out a survey , and find a survey . . . .	-10.0146
A survey among passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of objects deliberately or unconsciously prohibited were smuggled over the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points , including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft , while accidentally carrying banned knives or other objects with blades .	-10.5497
Less than 1 % claimed that they had discovered belatedly that they mistakenly travelled with guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-10.0326
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.4728
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % of the millennials were members of generation X , compared to less than 15 % .	-3.7906
The most common objects deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.0437
More than 3 % admitted knowingly to have carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft .	-4.5988
The company said that travellers throughout the country asked to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods would have been brought through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .	-5.3118
It is no surprise that the people who bear smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were those who fly most frequently .	-4.2206
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.5965
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them . . are . . . . .	-8.0524
So it is no surprise that the greatest amount of the liquids confiscated by the TSA are prohibited .	-3.9995
For a while , people thought that TSA could see books as smuggling goods .	-3.0160
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.7109
Elon Musk doesn ’ t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders .	-2.8608
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.5480
He has hitherto failed to suggest that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.3489
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla ’ s chief Elon Musk revealed for the first time another , less glamorous figure in announcing the latest quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-6.5545
In recent months , Musk had frequently advertised more than 500,000 preorders for the new car , which is currently being delivered .	-4.8691
Now Musk admits : Of the 518,000 preorders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-3.3099
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.7329
In the event of a cancellation , Tesla will fully refund the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 and UK $ 1000 ) " Reservation Deposit " .	-5.7004
Currently , 455,000 such non-binding reservations were available , Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts .	-4.1335
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders so far could become a problem .	-4.7349
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-2.9878
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.4087
In 2018 - all models combined - it is expected to be 500,000 , in 2020 a a . . . . . . . . . . . .	-10.6907
The demand for this is obvious .	-2.6162
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-1.9582
Those who order a " Model 3 " today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production roads , which have never been tested in practice , without major interruptions with maximum utilisation .	-6.1426
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4732
However , if there are major delays , the non-binding reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-4.5414
Because then , the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in sharks .	-5.9781
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws because of the delay in Obama Era ’ s rules to reduce emissions from emissions	-8.6088
One day after he was sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environment Protection Agency , withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog air pollutants .	-4.5761
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.9425
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been brought against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal .	-3.7120
This is a deadline for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for soil ozone .	-4.7098
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid " interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth " .	-3.6004
Pruitt , who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-10.3658
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry oppose .	-3.6414
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.9008
Last month , a federal appeal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority by trying to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitoring and reducing methane leaks .	-4.2493
In a statement published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his turnaround in ozone standards simply reinforced the EPO ’ s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in time .	-5.4836
" Under previous administrations , the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.3588
" We do not believe in a regulation through court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously .	-3.3865
We also take the law and the authority that we have ' seriously .	-2.5855
Nevertheless , the EPO 's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its ' power to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are ' based on a sound policy and the best available information ' .	-4.7668
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of the ozone rules .	-2.5666
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.6922
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.3991
The New York Public Prosecutor , Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of the states that sued the EPAs this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-4.2038
" The reversal of the EPAs - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.4261
New York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-2.1031
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .	-3.3413
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-3.2602
Representatives of public health and environmental protection cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.6513
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe in , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.3640
" We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to bid to polluters and their particular interests . "	-2.8898

In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first documented in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-4.4229
According to the wording of the document , in addition to the former parish church on the Tumlinger Mountain there was also a stately court , which included the church or patronage law , and not the other way round .	-6.4767
People also lived there .	-2.3621
As evidenced in the description of the Freudenstadt Oberdorf in 1858 , besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen , the " mountain " was the third , the rural centre of the village .	-7.5982
Old maps dating back to 1600 reinforce these historical realities . .	-16.0776
The patronage law was derived from the early Middle Ages own church law .	-4.9013
A Lord who built , equipped and occupied a church with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church .	-12.2467
This was linked to the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .	-4.1922
Three altars were found in the church and two bells on the tower .	-10.0286
The larger of the two crushed on Christmas 1673 .	-2.9389
The newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 1692 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .	-4.3165
In the 30-year-old war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the window windows were taken and the bell ropes were stolen .	-4.3300
The roof was leaked .	-2.0220
In 1796 French troops deposited near the church .	-4.4474
They broke out the candle and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-3.3750
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-2.0266
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler .	-3.1172
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church was aborted .	-3.4643
Only the church tower was left .	-2.5940
In the New Year 's Night of 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half crashed .	-3.6581
To prevent accidents , the tower was cancelled .	-3.3849
Only the still existing tower dwarf remained a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-4.8983
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the " Creative Pensioners " as successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility .	-4.1312
On Sunday 16 July , the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens invite to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery of St. Hilarius Chapel .	-5.1560
It is designed by the Combo des Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-3.6952
Town head Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .	-2.9941
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.6037
Entrance is from 3.30 p.m.	-2.8462
To the end of the serenade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .	-4.1814
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest " , the organizers show the fantastic view .	-4.9402
The serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.2926
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for tumblers and listeners .	-5.6294
The friends and supporters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to their home care , as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms .	-4.7972
Association wants to have approval of wind wheels examined	-4.3523
" Boisheim defends himself " does not see any legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the council .	-11.7758
The Boisheim Association has invited Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette .	-4.6406
It has been illegal .	-1.9994
The association argues that , at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind power plants could have been approved at the Boishimer Nette , since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal .	-5.9694
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind power plants are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone also excludes wind energy use for the rest of the city .	-5.8712
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being " saved " .	-3.9610
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the plans for land use , which had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form error .	-6.8826
" Due to the lack of a planning requirement , the approval declaration granted is still illegal and therefore withdrawal , " said Christoph Erkens , chairman of " Boisheim defends himself " .	-5.9368
Current state of affairs : Before the summer recess , the City Council once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; approval by the district government is still due .	-6.1771
Erkens : " This excludes planning permission for the construction of wind power plants at this point " .	-4.8328
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .	-1.6165
" The corresponding letters have been received by Viersen County since last week , " said a speaker .	-4.6187
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-3.7725
But they are not likely to stop the procedure .	-3.8982
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court on Thursday the district did not want to comment on the argument of the association " Boisheim defends itself " .	-5.7729
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning to build four 200 meters high wind turbines on an area on the Boishimer Nette .	-4.5296
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved , had already concluded leasing contracts with the owner of the area of about 65 hectares . .	-10.5491
With the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households are to be met - which corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all Foursen households .	-6.4905
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-2.4226
Last summer , Viersen ’ s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg .	-4.5996
Car and tractor collapse : Women die in the event of a terrible accident .	-3.9337
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Lower Wallmenach and Bogel ( Rhine-Lahn-Kreis ) .	-3.4240
A woman was fatally injured .	-2.2377
Two more people were slightly injured .	-1.9359
The Landesstra<unk>e remained closed for hours .	-2.1487
According to police data , a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich , with her car , took the L 333 in the direction of Bogel as part of the accompanying journey with her 53-year-old mother as an accompanying person .	-5.8756
City and merchants are planning " Homeland Shops " weekend - Weekend	-12.6394
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.4966
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .	-5.1211
As the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the " Homeland Shops " weekend is meant to raise awareness among customers of the offers offered by their own city beyond the usual supermarket goods .	-6.8610
So a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.6874
In addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places .	-4.0850
The shops of the city centre are also to be invited to the " Mitternachts-Shops " .	-5.6608
The action is aimed not only at inhabitants of the city and the nearby region .	-4.9520
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that indicate the action weekend , according to Christian König .	-3.8552
Town administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .	-3.5085
Thus the trade association and the city go into another stage of the " attractive city " project .	-5.4026
This includes new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Fountain and sold Sunday , talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-5.3794
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .	-3.6351
In addition , customer potential should be reopened or reopened .	-3.8939
These include spa guests and tourists .	-2.3452
But many locals would have lost sight of the city when shopping .	-4.6323
In the end , everyone would have to contribute to revitalising the city centre - to landlords , to the businesses of the whole city and associations .	-7.0372
It was supposed to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread , King said in spring .	-5.7019
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen , announced that for the first time five Thuringian cities participate in the nationwide third " Homeland Shops " Day .	-4.3620
In addition to Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Saint City and Bleicherode .	-9.5913
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its significance for the common good of our cities ' , says Streich .	-4.8269
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his or her purchasing behaviour can influence his or her direct environment .	-5.5561

During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .	-3.1226
New people have been injured .	-1.0688
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis , two people have been killed and nine more have been injured , some of them severely .	-3.3015

During the holidays , few people stayed in the Minneha Academy building .	-3.2639
After leaked transcripts of telephone calls , Trump pressured Mexico for paying the border wall	-2.7928
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-1.8128
On January 27 , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump called on him to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.0753
The US President insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall , saying to him : ' You cannot tell the press ' .	-5.1326
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and swore to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.4012
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.5404
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that trading for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia is " ridiculous " , " mies " , and " stupid " , and that the existence of the trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would make him a " depp " after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-6.1321
Mr Trump ended the call after saying to Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.0315
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists reinstate racist lynchact as a call for justice .	-3.8470
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumped to the Ford bridge of Moore .	-3.5887
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with guns emerged to block its path .	-3.0544
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windscreen testin.	-4.4716
Inside , the passengers were in fear .	-3.0722
" We want this n ---r Roger ! " the man rolled .	-3.3852
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.9898
Shouts torn the silence when a young black man was torn off the front-passenger seat .	-3.8431
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a replica .	-3.4717
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience fell out very real sights .	-4.5647
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were synthesized by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.1047
No one has ever been charged with the murders .	-2.1319
" It is truly inconceivable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organize supplies .	-5.4325
'It is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-3.0522
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgian Congressman and civil rights activist for a lifetime .	-3.7172
For him , reproduction serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.1900
" We want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-6.6607
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.4650
A court medical practitioner puts a sheet over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynch on July 27 , 1946 .	-11.8467
According to the FBI files received from the NBC news , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-9.7028
But no one has ever been charged .	-2.4962
Although suspects have been on the free foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for lynch action has always been known throughout the city : politics and sex .	-5.6792
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign .	-3.0555
About the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom stood a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a struggle , allegedly because of a woman .	-4.0622
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcoms Mrs Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying did not come from her husband .	-3.8967
On 25 July 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to lift Malcom out of prison , according to the FBI .	-2.6142
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey as a prison .	-7.5056
But when they moved away from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-2.9226
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes an FBI report .	-3.0433
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses " .	-4.1228
Brooks is even more concise .	-11.0316
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.3922
'They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , that will happen to you here ' .	-3.6309
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual replica of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-5.1682
Their portrayal is illustrative , gripping , and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America .	-5.6286
It is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.5657
" We do not want to talk about the lynch , because we are then confronted with its ugly nature in all of us , " she said .	-4.5142
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through " .	-3.9782
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece .	-4.8634
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director .	-2.2083
He has played the role of Chief Clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-3.2343
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.9019
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times ' .	-3.0127
On the other side of the room , actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.6898
The piece starts with Malcom , who cries to Hester and afflicts him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.3719
'I said n --- he disappears from my property ! '	-2.6665
Rascona replies the fire .	-1.8785
There is a break .	-0.8309
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.5560
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.7046
" What ? ! " asked Rascona .	-1.7519
He is alarmed and confused .	-1.1927
Was I too hard ?	-1.2271
" No " , Greene said , still kichrend .	-3.1934
" I simply do not believe that white people at the time ' n -- he ' said ' .	-4.0206
" But " one of the other black actors joked .	-2.8690
'You only have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-2.6388
And that is where the energy shifts in the room , a feeling of the camera replaces the unease .	-5.0589
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .	-3.0102
The scene starts again .	-1.1981
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-2.3445
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.3932
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.6497
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.5754
A woman , dressed with a dream , stands above the bodies of the actors and executes Billie Holidays ’ grievous lobrede " Strange Fruit " .	-5.1026
Your voice breaks with every second word .	-2.9197
About a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears blow their eyes .	-5.1930
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.9194
A couple has arrived from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the road .	-3.2960
They have experienced all almost eight hours of moisture in Georgia when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys .	-5.5449
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the lynch murders took place , the air feels spectacular .	-4.4887
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse name .	-3.1386
Children hook at their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whisper each other .	-11.0235
" They are not really dead , " a little boy murmurs as if he wanted to remember .	-4.2975
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it 's over .	-2.9284
The actors throw away the lynx rope and wipe off their tears .	-3.1480
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-2.5702
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms crying , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .	-12.5582
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-2.0950
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.6145
You did so for one reason ' .	-1.6307
Later , the audience meets the actors for dinner .	-3.4443
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta talks about the replica with a black couple they just met .	-4.7572
Denise Duplinski fought to find words about what feeling the performance left .	-3.2243
" It 's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you , " she said .	-3.6801
" What this really does with me allows me to believe that the lynch is still going on , " she added , " today it is only called police shooting . "	-5.5110
In the same room Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights .	-3.5699
He said he had already started planning the performance next year .	-2.2897
" The posting is in a way inspiring , because it describes the horrors of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.5735
" It 's like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-3.4152
Those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-3.3434
" Goddess " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth	-9.1809
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf is counting on a color-frivole staging in a gigantic , six-storey setting .	-4.8599
The platform ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) optionally shows a shabby street corner with wall rest and dönerbude in Berlin , a " plastic and elastic " logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-5.5302
Before that , an open Mercedes classic car , where the Rhine daughters posing as rockergirls , or alternatively an Isetta , parks .	-5.2324
Stacked oil barrels remind us of Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - which draws through his " ring " staging .	-4.4295
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Hotzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as well as in the Rheingold .	-3.4417
Kess seduces them Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , break a corpse into the boot in Hollywood manner and give the Krawallo-Clique .	-4.2226
Stephen Milling sings the magnificently tiled Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer .	-4.3392
Brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .	-2.0947
Later Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must believe in this .	-3.7866
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.9592
Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in stormy and the hands of the Merkel rod are formally concealed .	-6.5400
There is great applause for the festival orchestra , which is showing itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing .	-6.1796
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his director was eagerly awaited .	-3.3343
In 2013 , if he had to have a yellow whistle concert , there were five years later great anniversaries in which the isolated " bow " reputations went down .	-8.8413
Festspielchefin Katharina Wagner will have liked this .	-4.2612
" You notice that the audience has grown together with the " ring " in a way , " she said just before performing the dpa .	-4.8288
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but has also grown an understanding of his view .	-4.0790
I draw a positive response .	-2.1791

At the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul .	-1.7579
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack .	-1.9989
On May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US troops displaced the Taliban from power in 2001 .	-4.0641
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Trump is weighing up the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country .	-2.9908
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani .	-3.3514
EPA reverses the decision to delay the smog rule after complaints about	-11.9616
The US Environment Protection Agency has repealed a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration that states are obliged to contain smog-causing emissions , one day after 15 states sued the Agency for steps .	-5.8331
Late on Wednesday , the EPO announced the decision to push forward the so-called ' ozone provisions 2015 ' , and said it demonstrated the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-4.8755
" We believe in dialogue with and in reacting to our state partners , " said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.4116
In June , Pruitt announced the EPO 's intention to delay the ozone rules - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year until October 2018 .	-5.3594
A group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-10.8250
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a broad range of environmental constraints imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to stimulate economic growth , according to Trump .	-3.1335
However , efforts have triggered the backlash of democrats and conservation groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-4.2971
The EPO 's website says that inhaling air containing ozone " can reduce lung function and strengthen breathing symptoms " such as asthma .	-3.6805
The municipal council wants Community area	-4.0782
In the end , the decision was clear : in the event of two votes against , the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to establish a Community area in the future elderly residence .	-5.2820
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property has been signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-4.7173
While it will take until the church community has been owned by the church , there is no longer any planning barrier to the project to be managed by a private investor .	-14.9768
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-3.3171
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .	-2.9483
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square metres for a special price .	-4.5003
The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose that such a common area should not be used as a meeting point only for the residents of the municipality , but rather openly into the municipality .	-7.7112
As an example , the word " knitting café " made the round .	-3.5393
The decision taken by the allocation of funds for the current budget as early as last autumn will be sweetened by means of funding opportunities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-15.2009
The construction is in the rehabilitation area .	-2.9544
The establishment of a Community area , Tjaden reports , would be eligible for funding at 60 % of 30 % .	-4.1193
The proposal for a decision , in order to signal to the investor that there is no desire to throw him in this respect between his feet , provides for the observation that both saddle - which is based on the construction of the environment - and powder roof - which reduces the height of the gravel and makes the construction more economical .	-8.8526
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer think that this addition is unnecessary .	-3.6325
If it helps , it will happen unanimously .	-4.1536
The Community area is not as easy as that .	-2.8495
Daniela 's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which we are not so much advanced , for which we are now leaning out of the window in the common room , she says : ' I am doing it hard ' .	-7.9990
Yvonne Staiger is strongly in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against municipal participation .	-4.3335
It sees a concealed subsidy to wealthy or even foreign investors .	-4.1233
This is not the case , because the acquisition of the surface does not give any subsidy , but rather receives a genuine value that can be marketed in the event of doubt , is the opposite speech .	-15.4886
Staiger ’ s proposal to split up the proposal for a decision accordingly has three supporters .	-4.1617
This is the case with two contradictions to the original programme , which Stefan Haller sums up : ' If we take the decision in this way , we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.9647
Collision with Auto : Cycling on the road is spun on the road .	-6.7553
At the crossing of the road , an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Garath and seriously injured .	-3.9993
As the police pointed out , the 82-year-old Langenfelder had travelled on his bike on the cycle path of the Black Road from Hilden to Hilden at 12.20 p.m.	-6.0565
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the Am Buchholzer Busch road .	-3.4009
A passenger car guide in the same direction gave him priority .	-4.1922
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road , he apparently did not respect the opposite traffic .	-5.2964
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener .	-4.4662
The man was thrown into the street .	-3.1322
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a rescue car .	-3.5308

Seven professionals lack the title defender in the supercup against the Cup winner .	-3.0100
The staffing concerns at the German football record champion Bavaria Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday ( 8.30 p.m. / ZDF and Eurosport ) at Cup winner Borussia Dortmund .	-5.8500
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also renounce David Alaba in the duel with the BVB .	-3.4848
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .	-1.7483
In addition , Munich ’ s Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing .	-2.4985
Ancelotti blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team for the five defeats in the last six test matches .	-4.6779
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-3.1201
It was not good at the end of the day . '	-3.1472
The 58-year-old believes in improving performance in the first official duty game of the season .	-3.5821
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.1590
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-2.1497
The team is ready .	-0.7989
We want to play intelligently , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intense game " .	-2.2934
The duel of the two German football weights attracts the fans .	-4.6898
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators , announced the German Football League ( DFL ) on Friday .	-3.0961
Walking from Stern to Stern	-3.0783
In the resin , the first " Star Trail " is to be created nationwide .	-4.7469
The Association Starwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans this .	-3.1459
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.9292
A " Star Trail " responds to the need for information from many resin visitors , it was said .	-4.3655
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.1454
The members want to lay down tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-11.9769
In a first phase until 2018 , the Association plans " well accessible installations in five to six locations " in Oberresz .	-5.0102
St. Andreasberg , brown layer , Hohegeiss and Sieber would be called into question .	-4.5029
The information on the panels should be supplemented via the Internet .	-3.7776
This is why good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .	-5.0407
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.1554
Later , the Star Trail will be extended by train .	-3.9772
" On the Star Trail , the viewers learn a lot of interesting things , such as the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-5.6360
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why a star shines more than another , even though it is much further away .	-4.7396
It also explains where a selected star is in and when it is best to see .	-5.7967
Since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest star warehouse in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-13.5629
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.4933
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with a naked eye .	-4.0839
Since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Foundation , there has been something similar to the planned Star Werg - the Planetenweg .	-4.5993
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg with its steels leads up to the Hainberg and the Starnwarte - as well as an " alien " location in Diemarden ( municipality of equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-5.3527
The steels with the individual planets - including the degraded pluto at the end point to the dwarf planet - are situated exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-5.6458
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the exactly 75 metres away sun measures 70 centimetres .	-4.3940
The entire distance of the planet route is about four kilometres .	-3.6049
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to the steel with Pluto .	-4.1657
Pedestrians are thus faster than light in space .	-8.9193
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .	-3.6819
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown to discuss a a a .	-11.6894
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under <unk> 147 , met for the first time on Thursday .	-3.9984
They were in separate spaces in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Spring Weight Champion .	-6.2159
After Garcia 's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five pound-for pound list .	-3.7312
Garcia stretched the right hand and said : " How do you go , Champion ?	-2.8587
I wish you good luck . '	-1.1501
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN .	-2.1523
When the couple positioned for photos , Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect magnitude " .	-3.4612
" I am a former spring weight , " Garcia reminded .	-2.5454
" I have risen for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.1954
I am small for 140 .	-0.7057
I would like to come down to light weight .	-2.7702
And he must move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.1318
That is what fans are demanding .	-2.8121
Let us give them that . '	-1.4135
Lomachenko agreed .	-1.0866
'Boxing needs this fight ' .	-2.4178
Climates asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) that also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .	-4.6046
" This struggle could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for him , " said Garcia and later expressed openly fighting with the network that offers the best financial package .	-4.3944
We are the best .	-0.6309
No other name can generate this kind of attention .	-1.6066
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.3174
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " , and he might participate in his Saturday fight .	-4.5280
But Lomachenko stopped with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the tri-fighting champion from Riverside look " very slow , I am sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-5.3407
Garcia said that the focus is to show starch , then boxes .	-3.0366
Both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle .	-3.4340
" This is the battle that must be carried out .	-2.9429
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-1.8893
I 'm more than happy to work on this , " said Garcia .	-7.6890
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.2383
It will be a great battle . '	-1.7279
Four Injured after Reifenplatzer	-2.2854
In the case of an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .	-2.9153
According to the first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at about 4.30 p.m. shortly before the connecting point Marktwidt probably after a tire platform .	-6.5511
The car went right into evil , where it overshooted and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .	-6.7161
The four passengers - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident .	-2.5253
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 to the north was closed for about an hour , and then the traffic could be passed on the left lane at the accident site .	-6.6441
Fortuna 's Hoffmann : ' Triple chain works better '	-2.3499
After 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue points will be the start of the season against Braunschweig .	-6.0936
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , and the result would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-5.3795
" Two counter-goals were too much , and we need to be more careful in Aue , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defender .	-5.1436
In the Ore Mountains , the tri-chain is to be further optimized .	-4.8943
And a gate after a free-knock , the fortunes no longer want to catch up .	-6.6211
'For the future , it will be the case that nobody else will take the line alongside Michael ( rensing ) ' .	-5.8007
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the trichain even after the experience of preparing for the trichain than with the four chain .	-6.6325
" I do not yet know how we will be acting in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have in the tri-chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.2844
" It is a prerequisite , but that we harmonise even better and we do not afford so many playback errors in the construction . "	-6.2780
Of course Hoffmann also travels to Aue to win the game .	-3.0755
" But if you can speak of a failed start after a draw , you don 't know .	-4.9738
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-3.5859
" However , if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the Cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season . "	-13.3367
His coach did not want to know about this .	-3.1142
" I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm .	-5.6008
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that players from Aue might even be somewhat fresher , because they don 't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a favorite ascent in the bones .	-6.3684
" But they do not know 100 % where they currently stand , " says the Fortuna interior defender .	-3.7622
The guests from the Rhineland , as a light favorite , will meet at the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday .	-5.8317
" That we swept them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stupidity , " says Funkel , whose record is very positive with only one defeat against the eye from nine games .	-7.0158
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that must be beaten from the outset , " explains Fortuna 's chief coach .	-4.0549
" Such a statement would be arrogant and overstated " .	-3.5632
And so Funkel doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-3.1741
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published	-2.7396
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of tested people are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.2426
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority ( Rättsmedicinalverkett ) started the tests last year .	-3.6336
During the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Migration Selling ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-5.8677
To date , migration sales have sent 6,880 cases to test , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31st July 2017 .	-4.6713
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-2.7347
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-2.9316
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-2.8561
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.6050
" We do not see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are quite constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.4437
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-2.9943
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases " proposing that the investigated person be 18 years or older " .	-2.9415
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-3.9190
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-ray pictures of wisdom teeth and MRT pictures of knee joints are made , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-5.2435
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether sooner or later they went through puberty as usual .	-4.1792
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not think the type of measurement should be used .	-2.6137
To judge the biological age in this way is very unsafe .	-10.7582
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could do it , " he said to the newspaper Metro .	-3.5117
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low .	-3.2230
The biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . '	-4.6530
Fully in the Plan	-2.1227
Work on the three bridges of Landstra<unk>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.2697
On Wednesday , a seven tonnes of concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.8127
" We are very good at the time , it runs super " , says Reinhold Leicht , Construction Manager at the Street and Transport Department in the Freiburg Regional Council .	-6.0102
In April , work began simultaneously on all three needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.3888
The building end is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is respected .	-4.4177
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-2.5113
It is a concrete vaulted arched bridge covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-3.7027
It was built in 1900 .	-1.1639
Like the other two bridges , it has now entered the years .	-2.6595
The three buildings are now thoroughly renovated to ensure stability and road safety .	-5.0923
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach .	-2.5624
They are made of red sandstone .	-1.6557
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 , or 10.60 meters long .	-2.6559
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a bridge cap of 1.30 metres wide and seven tons heavy on Wednesday morning on the north side .	-4.5306
This is a boundary fastening which is also used as a working route .	-5.2377
On the southern part of the bridge a bridge cap of 2.20 metres is to be used on Friday .	-4.0138
That is what the pedestrian path should be .	-4.0060
The particular thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo .	-4.6345
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.2969
Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of lines through the construction in Lauterbach .	-5.5588
Because there is also a fibre optic cable , to which many companies are connected .	-4.5347
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand papers .	-3.6887
In addition , fish and cancer had to be fished first .	-3.0817
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Collective Weiher in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a single traffic light .	-5.9875
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " is fully closed .	-4.7408
Together , the cost of the three renovations is EUR 700 000 .	-4.0482
It is funded by the country .	-10.8713
AfD in Gerolstein : Colorful protest at German potato salad	-2.5131
It does not happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , it meets , otherwise it is difficult to reconcile .	-14.4256
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that is peacefully flagging this day , because the AfD invites the Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell to the poster " Great campaign opening " .	-6.2414
And well known names come to the start - like Alice Weidel , who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and Deputy Chairman Beatrix von Storch .	-5.2198
But those who are already on the spot hours before the event begins do not want to listen to the AfD students , but to demonstrate .	-5.1476
The motto " The Eifel remains colourful " .	-2.3656
Originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto " All at a table " on the fountain square , but now takes place in the car park below the Rondells - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-6.6209
A colourful picture that offers itself .	-3.1845
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the Forum Ein Welt and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : " Toll , how many people have come together here " .	-5.2318
There is music and plenty of food , including a " urban potato salad , which the AfD could eat easily , " says the woman who brought him with him .	-4.4856
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and they also show their presence at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .	-5.3649
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.9838
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcano Eifel reported that he tried to attend such an event and received the award .	-5.9526
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun but got a rejection there because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces .	-5.8420
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a beautiful event here " .	-3.1495
With a view to the event at the Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.5864
This is also the case : around 8 p.m. a band will entertain you on the Rondellvorplatz , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rheinland-Pfälzische AfD chairman Uwe Junge .	-6.8269
In the Chamber there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Weidel , and Deputy Chairman Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches .	-4.5123
The police presence is unchanged , but officials have had a quiet evening so far .	-3.1947
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the football court have a longer breath , but also there is a schedule to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.	-7.9362
The police can move away - no special incidents . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-10.2745
Trumpet Meets Trumpet	-1.5358
A repeat of the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslach monastery concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .	-5.2257
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov , he gives a concert under the motto " Black Sea meets the Black Forest " , or even " Balkan folklore " meets a classical German education with roots in blass music .	-4.3607
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras .	-2.8953
Petkov is solo performer at the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo sauna of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .	-3.8446
Both unite the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .	-3.7436
For example , Johann Sebastian Bach performs with the two as in a new cloth , Daniel Schnyder 's " World Music " combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece " Exchange Suite " by Nils Wogram , the jazz choir , mixing classical , jazz and free playing into a fascinating collection of art .	-7.7543
This core of the programme was premiered only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .	-3.1794
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more : the Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert .	-4.4736
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality .	-1.1352
" Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .	-1.8734
But I want to try everything " , Kristen Stewart said quite openly about her bisexuality .	-2.8809
'When I bite in grilled cheese , I think ' Oh that was cool , what comes next ? ' .	-4.1067
The Hollywoodstar 's most famous relationship was that of her Twilight colleague Robert Pattinson , who eventually diverged bitterly .	-4.5133
Despite all this , the brunette actress assured the " Harper 's Bazaar " magazine : " I was seriously in love with anyone I thought .	-12.3155
Or do you think I had played it ? '	-2.8270
After her separation , Cristen admitted that she was bisexual : " I have always lived dualism and seriously believed it .	-10.4609

Coe praises " honest " Russian excuse for doping scandal	-1.6769
On Thursday , the world leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-admitted to sport .	-4.5736
Russia ’ s athletic leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World athletics championships that his country ’ s ban from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-3.9126
He said he was sorry for " all athletes who were scrapped gold and silver medals in competitions " .	-4.3227
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) had found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-10.2144
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.0975
" The whole Council and the whole of Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognised itself that it experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . "	-5.6060
Coe said that he was also ' pleased ' that Russia accepted the criteria for reintroducing it .	-10.1833
" I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia , " said Coe .	-3.2883

Mourning guests put roses down , the families stood in arm with the coffins .	-5.0179

Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election	-1.9976
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.4880
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a rapid re-election of Landtag after the loss of the Red Green majority , but he does not want to resign .	-4.2954
Because , on Friday , it was in favour of the dissolution of Parliament .	-4.0042
Previously , the surprising exit of a Green MEP from their Landtag faction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . in in in in . in in . in in in . in	-9.2771

" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hannover .	-2.1694
CDU leader Björn Thümler will recommend his group to accept them .	-3.8117
The CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag , the SPD and the Greens .	-4.7108
So far , the relationship has been the opposite .	-2.5153
The new Landtag will be regularly elected on 14 January next year .	-2.9553
Thümler said that the Red Green Government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority .	-3.6595
However , Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the Landtag decides its self-resolution as soon as possible .	-4.8239
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-2.9304
The constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day will deprive the Prime Minister of confidence and elect a successor .	-5.2271
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.5840
These opportunities need to be examined legally , " said Thümler .	-3.9334
'You will be able to discuss all the issues in a calm manner if they are considered legally reasonable . '	-6.7798
Thümler called Twesten step " but rather curios " .	-3.7159
The politician himself emphasised : " I am not a traitor .	-6.8767
I feel very good ' .	-1.6948
She called herself a supporter of black and green .	-3.3359
The Greens called on the dissenting Members to return their country 's mandate .	-3.9369
" Naturally , we assume that it will return with immediate effect the country ’ s mandate that it has received through the green list , " said Chairman Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-6.3154
The group chairman Anja Piel said : ' We greatly regret Elke Twesten 's decision ' .	-3.3803
You have deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-2.8764
'Even in view of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step ' .	-4.0142
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transgression of the Dutch Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-3.1496
" The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to the voters , but also betrayal to the Red Green , " the Federal Chief of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-4.6872
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to quickly reelect the country ’ s day .	-3.9720
Exit Twesten costs Red Green in Lower Saxony a majority .	-11.7027
The politician " in her injured vanity and frustration put her personal interests before the welfare of the country " , criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil .	-4.4708
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intriguing game and tries to make political capital out of it " .	-4.2132
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU leader , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend that his MEPs include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-3.2937
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of distorting the outcome of the 2013 national election with personal career thinking .	-4.2570

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.1207
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.9893
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.3099
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.2268
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.0435
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.4765
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in their refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .	-3.1450
On the consumer protection portal www.Food Warnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg batches .	-4.8896
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-1.2605
Even if , after everything we know at the moment , there is virtually no risk to health .	-4.1217
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the Federal Agriculture Minister does not really perceive the central role of the enlightener ?	-4.9179
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states .	-2.9625
Nevertheless , my house has been in contact with the authorities of the countries immediately and has been in close contact with the German authorities since it became known .	-7.4178
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.0220
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are transport and health safe .	-4.0587
If eggs exceed the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg , they are not transportable .	-4.0067
Unloaded eggs can be sold and eaten .	-9.2123
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-2.3853
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?	-2.9588
According to the current state of knowledge , production plants are not directly .	-4.2992
Instead , they must expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-4.2125
As always , there are too few controllers in the event of a serious problem .	-5.1066
Is it only missing from staff or also from coherent competence ?	-5.1689
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.1827
However , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 % .	-3.1409
It is precisely for this reason that consistent information on such events and the transfer to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist are crucial .	-6.8697
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities responsible to be fully informed .	-3.6721
Is the regular alarmism of food scandals really necessary ?	-7.0992
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transport foods .	-3.7477
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.6178
The armoured means have put manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-4.8292
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the Fipronil insecticide in the attitude of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately .	-4.4369
This must be done consistently and with great pressure at all levels .	-3.6497
I expect all the competent authorities to be informed quickly and without delay .	-4.6735
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.4632
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure from European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.3758
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the senior organisation that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-4.1917
Financial Fair Play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses .	-3.8306
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .	-5.3793
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.1713
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs and brings him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar .	-5.2972
Clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but they must counteract legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to play the break event point in their football business .	-6.5039
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.1858
The former French player believed that clubs that had borrowed enormous debt in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-4.1061
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentrating on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.1045
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter .	-3.8022
During the current three-year FFP installation period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can tolerate losses of € 30 million .	-4.3281
And , while Platini in 2015 fell in disgrace by the presidency , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to argue for discouraging excessive spending .	-4.5582
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , against The Associated Press last week .	-3.7336
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the accounting for the duration of its contract .	-4.0716
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the replacement sum of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years can be recorded in the annual accounts .	-4.8500
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG , together with Abu Dhabi , who holds Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .	-3.0423
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season should be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-20.5069
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overload their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .	-5.2633
While a catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring exceeded the standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income .	-4.7423
That is what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.7428
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments by the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 .	-3.9427
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors , and that such a manoeuvre could easily be found for UEFA regulators .	-3.6451
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.0655
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar 's transfer , said the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday .	-3.4801
You spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity , as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.8811
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015 / 16 , with sales of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.9222
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published .	-2.6023
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising , and tricot sales .	-2.8420
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-3.7270
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.5695
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-3.3726
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La Lega against a state financing an association .	-3.4391
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years , " Wenger said on Thursday .	-3.0737
" As soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.7892
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.8455
Swiss is looking for a new Choggi supplier .	-3.2727
In recent years Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss .	-3.4899
Now the sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline is rewriting the order .	-4.6812
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report from Friday 's newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " on request from the news agency sda .	-12.2327
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.1665
The products are checked every two to three years and subject to quality control .	-3.1593
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.9785
Approximately 17 million small red white wrapped shoggi tables of 14 grams each year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers prior to landing .	-5.6180
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .	-3.5180
Industrial insiders estimate the order volume according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual turnover of approximately one billion francs .	-4.4356
But the advertising effect is always more important : it is a prestigious order for a Schoggi manufacturer .	-4.4161
The Swiss will not betray the number of applicants in the new tender .	-4.1025
However , only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-2.5756
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to seek to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-2.8234
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.8340
Chocolate tables have been distributing Swiss on board their flights since 2006 .	-2.8880
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug .	-3.2672
The possibility of placing the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.3350

Nostalgia enters the niche in " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-2.0824
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s , for the 90-year-old Grunge era ( when the previews David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went on larger things .	-5.3762
As a cultural artifact , it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-2.6524
But as a franchise , it feels like time is short .	-2.5135
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a talking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . a " . " " " . " " . " " , " " " " " " " " " "	-8.4540
By testing on the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless created the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke .	-5.5417
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting sculpture principle , including a reef to the stalker movies of the 1990s such as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that rocks the cradle " ) .	-5.6848
At one point , a character runs through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.5276

The loving Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novelist , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-4.5292
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.8571
And there is another mad plot involving Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.7340
As always , excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.6007
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillons Unterlippenbart of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-3.7937
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-4.3804
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the movie " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its east-to-west ring-fighting iconography .	-4.2371
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director claims to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism .	-4.1727
The main roles - a hard scored Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-3.4623
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.2149
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.5529
There are some nice gags to watch ( the police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .	-3.7459
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find out the voice ' .	-3.0257
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.5471
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-4.0349
" Comrade Detective " , which has been edited to a lower length , could deliver his agitprop satire better , because Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a cluster of Hamburg .	-5.8691

The police succeeded in a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-2.6205
On Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Baar district , Rottweim , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched , as the Konstanz Public Prosecutor announced on Friday .	-4.2359
Fifteen accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and were already issued arrest warrants against them .	-4.1778
In addition , officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros .	-8.5774
Two people were arrested on the same raids in Italy .	-3.3789
There were German arrest warrants against the two Italian suspects .	-2.6560
The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .	-2.9388
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.3842
Overall , more than 300 police officers were in operation .	-2.7371
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder and robbery and blackmail .	-3.4170
Since summer 2016 , Konstanz Public Prosecutor ’ s Office has been investigating organised drug trafficking in Southern Germany .	-3.9422
There was a strong exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo , and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.0922
Thus , on Wednesday morning , four Palermo officials also accompanied the major operations .	-4.1875
The study focused mainly on Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian mafia .	-4.7961
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired in the morning to a restaurant , is likely to go to the band 's account .	-5.6389
Well , there are big gaps in the Foreign Register	-5.1578
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : According to a report , the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-4.6186
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-2.5589
The Federal Government ’ s Refugee Management Representative , Frank-Jürgen Weg , has , according to a media report , drawn attention to major gaps in the Central Register of Foreign Affairs .	-5.2471
In the case of asylum procedures and deportations , deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to " partially serious mistakes " , warned in an analysis presented by the " Süddeutsche Zeitung " .	-6.2447
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are covered , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.0380
The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.1435
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality had not been good in parts .	-4.6472
In individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , ' from people who have long since ceased to live , or from citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register ' .	-5.3465
" Missing data input can slow return processes considerably , " says the report .	-10.0170
Moreover , statistics on people who are obliged to leave leave include EU citizens who would not have to leave at all .	-5.7041
However , such false allocations ' led to a distorted debate on the handling of expatriates ' , the analysis says .	-5.6050
Meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with under 16 years of age back to Italy when they arrived there .	-11.9452
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reported by the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-3.8186
Accordingly , the paper states that the BAMF has carried out such proceedings " on families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 " .	-5.1122
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , according to the newspaper pointing to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.6088
According to the Dublin Agreement , refugees are the responsibility of the EU State that they reach first .	-4.3667
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can send it back to the country of entry .	-3.8417
As for the reasons , the office now writes : " In the meantime , the capacity for absorption for families with minors in Italy has increased significantly " .	-7.0743
Italy has given guarantees for families ’ reception and accommodation .	-11.6146
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments sufficient .	-2.2014
Other EU countries , too , would send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.5098
The left-wing political spokesperson in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : " Families with children are threatening conditions of absorption and a threat to the welfare of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system .	-6.5380
The Second Best Result	-2.9678
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberrienbach has already provided the blood donation service to other people .	-3.9509
At least of the twelve citizens who have been awarded Friday .	-9.1014
Jürgen Greule , who , with his 100 donations , now shared 50 litres of blood .	-4.7127
Traditionally , the municipality recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the municipal council .	-4.3655
" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers , not to mention self-serving , " Mayor Karlheinz Kistner pointed out .	-6.7565
" A single donation of blood helps several people " , explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the canned ones are divided into their components .	-5.9264
Three people could already benefit from donating blood .	-3.4518
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberrienbach .	-3.7801
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK Creiswillingness Leader .	-4.6823
Obviously , the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .	-3.5260
Even before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each . .	-3.6889
Half as many booked Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Prommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter delivered ten times per 500 millilitres of their life juice .	-4.1775
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-7.0436
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation mitigation have dampened speculation about an increase .	-4.2428
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " slow " when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure .	-3.4619
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) policymakers agreed at 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.4165
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 , and to 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to nearly 3 % in the autumn . . . in . in .	-15.5205
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would become necessary in the coming years to curb the inflation fueled by Brexit , and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.5161
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.5650
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with GBP 115 billion .	-5.2379
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the MPC 's central forecast , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on real household incomes continues to burden consumption ' .	-4.6064
On interest rates , it repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be necessary to cool inflation and a ' somewhat larger ' scale than markets expect .	-4.0985
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.8251
The Bank , however , stressed that increases would be " progressive " and " limited " . .	-3.7287
The Bank ’ s downward adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-3.4682
It maintained its growth forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 .	-3.5278
The pound fell following these news against the dollar and the euro .	-9.7935
The pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 euro.	-2.3653
The decision to make no changes will come after the recent disappointing growth figures have mitigated the rising expectations of raising interest rates , and GDP in the second quarter has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .	-5.3422
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the bank by the end of the year .	-3.3201
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases , as the tightening becomes even worse before it becomes better .	-4.6429
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income collapse in the coming years , but she added that wages will recover " markedly " at the end of their three-year forecast .	-4.7523
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumption spending .	-3.4161
The decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-12.4032
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve full prices and the economy .	-3.2156
Before the Bank ’ s last sentence on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .	-4.9363
Inflation has fallen from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that it was expected to do so and will recover it in the coming months .	-4.7220
The Bank said that exceeding the 2 % target was " totally " attributed to the weak pound .	-4.7266
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are loudly looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.6822
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals expire and the new mortgages complete , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-4.5895
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people .	-2.6637
Patients will gain access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a struggle against the financing of the drug in the NHS .	-5.5000
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) taken before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now supplied by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-4.6990
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should fund it .	-12.3221
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a " important new intervention " , while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " .	-4.0977
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.1564
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.2045
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in the case of infectious persons .	-3.6359
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.2924
Such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.2076
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-2.9665
In clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.4499
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local sexual clinic .	-4.1702
The program will sign $ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .	-3.1663
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as it is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-5.0172
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.6358
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . '	-9.9222
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.3410
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.7131
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .	-12.9315
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.5437
Ian Green , CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-4.3773
Now that PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV ' .	-3.5923
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitation by the government .	-3.3950
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.0292
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.8382
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and to help us move a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.3887
Living the great life : intermediate floors and clever designer tricks have transformed these small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.3537
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , diminished from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-2.9338
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-3.1957
" Before that I lived in a much larger space with my ex-Knightsbridge , " says Joanne .	-3.4576
" I was looking for something that was similar to my price .	-9.2693
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-1.9996
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day ' .	-2.8020
Since the first visit the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.4110
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .	-4.3049
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.3561
That was my request , " she says .	-1.7796
To this end , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.0468
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand .	-3.8754
Initially had to think creatively to solve the default .	-3.4143
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.2325
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked above each other without having to bake ourselves .	-4.6521
It was not just a question of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-4.7694
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two spaces in full height above each other - with much additional drama .	-10.4218
A classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area on the mezzanine floor .	-3.7822
Mixed gold furniture , silver accents and vintage serge mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.6618
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.9079
On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer .	-3.3106
In the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.3935
At the entrance , mirrored units provide space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses .	-2.7963
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.1284
Foldable kitchens are nothing new .	-2.7063
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-3.2988
" A little engineering art went into it , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-3.7155
'It is counterweight so that when you push the door up , it glides very easily ' .	-4.4247
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne won an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.8069
" At the end of the day , you will sell the ground floor or how your property is valued , " says Erfan .	-4.1926
'In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the ground ' .	-4.0606
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.3108
" The materials are the things that touch you and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-4.3146
" You don 't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.4120
They are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.2375
It shows that a flat can be transformed by good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing .	-5.1993
In fact , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-2.4173
Brothers struggle for $ 500 million in real estate empire	-3.2208
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are in dispute over one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.0171
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother , Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared .	-4.4011
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-4.0007
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers owned 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family bought a store in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.8991
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops .	-2.8927
It was sold in 1999 for USD 85 million .	-1.4586
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs .	-3.6379
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of corporate wealth and Paul about one-third .	-4.4589
A court act states that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million worth of property and Paul , worth $ 176 million .	-3.6857
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem point for Paul .	-2.5792
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-2.7941
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.4064
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , has excluded him .	-4.2904
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently .	-2.6652
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.2832
" My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the main priority , " he wrote .	-2.5494
Costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages of affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-4.2492
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.2804
They used security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family .	-3.0033
Colin says that he started Westco when he was ' the high school in my last years when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . '	-4.2681
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons amicably .	-2.4074
" Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " she wrote .	-2.4696
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and $ 26 million in leaving the company .	-3.4695
Both Luka and Mark are , Paul says , " become embittered about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-4.7453
Colin was very reluctant , even though he was a former AFL board member , and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire , he was the best friend of the TV star . . . . , . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.2555
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.4007
Only Colin replied via SMS to say " I really cannot say much " because the case is in the courts .	-3.8727
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.7949
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.5586
" Our father didn 't want Paul and I would end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hopes for a solution " .	-3.4970
On Friday , that hope seemed to have gone . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-9.8725
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.5620
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.4596
Others have tried and failed .	-1.5099
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-1.7793
If so , it will be the first .	-1.1406
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information on President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the Chief on a more even-handed course . .	-4.1386
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.3680
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House Chief of Staff , met senior executives on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that comes into the hands of the president .	-4.7527
Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he were given good information . '	-16.5855
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diversity .	-1.6980
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.0074
" If candidate Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from posts to be convinced , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunrg in February to Politico .	-4.1637
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keep Trump 's Twitter habit under control is , according to six former campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . "	-3.8617
Okay .	-0.5358
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been " under control " is ridiculous .	-2.1686
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained more fuel without their interventions .	-3.9804
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.6287
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .	-4.6115
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.1745
Part of the problem is that , in a White House composed of competing parties , people are repeatedly trying to push their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may encourage their views from the world .	-5.6070
Politico - all concerned with this story - reported in May about the advisers ' preference to provide the President with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-5.1269
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.2774
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is trying to find out where they come from .	-4.2962
This was precisely what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the source behind a bunch of leaks in the White House .	-4.2361
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence , or that in the past he made false accusations and revoked them .	-4.6134
Trump read the article and began to consult staff about Walsh . "	-2.3071
Goldmakers added that then-Chief of Staff Rence Priebus and the White House Secretary-General , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives . "	-4.7410
How did this work ?	-1.3154
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.6398
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than a priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.2234
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.9517
Major criminals are sent to Europol by post .	-4.5969
As the address is unknown , the people are asked to help and hoped for .	-4.6726
The police throughout Europe are sending ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the flight this summer .	-3.6959
As the addresses of the severe criminals who are sought are naturally unknown , references from the population are hoped and requested .	-6.4651
Europol reported on Friday about the action that follows the EU Most Wanted Advent Calendar of winter .	-4.0645
Experience would have shown that many refugees hide at holiday destinations , it was called Europol .	-3.7991
21 postcards have been compiled for sought criminals from 21 EU countries .	-3.5841
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwated , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .	-4.6582
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to references after the publication on the website .	-5.2208
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' Millionaires ' series ' .	-6.4683
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back on war with some determined travellers who negotiated a municipal ditch to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .	-5.6542
The passengers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous road of Solihull , which is called the " Millionaires series " .	-4.0017
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters only after they were cast out in May , but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incidents .	-14.0890
The tactful group found a gap in defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-3.7505
angry residents have afflicted the Solihull Council , which said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.0862
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones on the passers-by .	-3.7659
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.0670
The travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .	-3.4421
More came yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.5480
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by providing long instructions to protect its parks .	-3.3754
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.5920
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said : ' It is ridiculous , we have only just seen the last round of these travellers to be plundered by another round .	-4.4244
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-3.6442
A spokesperson of the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police force and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as soon as possible .	-6.0247
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-3.0692
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . '	-4.5039
From Birkenhof will Waldhotel Luise	-1.6007
From the former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise .	-2.1080
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.7286
That is good news for the city .	-1.6065
After all , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30 000 overnight stays were lost each year and revenue was also lost by the tourist tax .	-5.6138
In the autumn of 2014 , the hotel building was offered as a collection of accommodation to the Landratsamt Office , given dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district , causing controversial discussions .	-6.7104
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.7445
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at that time .	-11.5647
But above all the city of pleasure , Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and talked about serious interested parties in the house .	-6.5589
He should be right .	-1.0415
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category called Waldhotel Luise .	-4.5540
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object .	-3.3283
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.2077
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.7022
At the former Hotel Birkenhof , construction rubber containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house you will see how extensive renovation works are carried out .	-5.8473
The floors were torn out , ceilings partially dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-4.0970
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-2.6354
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.1923
" It 's really a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.0062
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-8.5198
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is changed , new windows are installed .	-4.9309
Everything should later become " beautiful close to the citizen " , as Thomas Scherer puts it .	-4.9753
'We want to make a jewel out of it ' .	-3.2176
Swimming pool , spa area and meeting room are all equipped .	-4.2822
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.4228
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be situated wide , explains Scherer further .	-4.5773
Individual holidaymakers , groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel .	-4.2839
He had discussions with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause , according to Scherer .	-3.3331
The city ’ s ideas are similar to those of the hotel group .	-4.0359
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.6145
Asked about the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise .	-4.1509
Nearly under one million euros , he expects .	-4.8840
The external installations are also being brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .	-4.8180
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .	-4.0369
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.6012
Russia affair : US Special Investors deploys Grand Jury to a Grand Jury	-4.9242
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump , special investigator Robert Mueller , according to a report , has appointed a so-called Grand Jury .	-4.1185
The panel has begun work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " calling on people familiar with the matter .	-4.8706
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.0755
The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-11.7250
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-2.6789
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.5474
The investigation focuses on several men acting as Republican adviser in the campaign .	-4.5514
According to reports , Mueller also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.2331
A few weeks ago , the " Washington Post " wrote that the special investigator personally put Trump in the centre and investigated the accusation of whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-5.5360
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence before us in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to make charges .	-4.9287
Grand juries are therefore also mentioned as chambers of prosecution .	-5.0030
Mostly they are switched on when there are major and controversial cases .	-3.8237
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .	-2.4618
The Board may also be activated by the Public Prosecutor in order to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-5.0371
According to the CNN channel , subpoenas have already been issued to address the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.2354
People who took part in the meeting had been asked to make a statement , it was stated in the . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-14.5696
They should also provide documents .	-1.1660
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were also involved in the conversation .	-4.9221
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the appointment showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he would act quickly .	-5.0556
However , it should not necessarily be said that the Grand Jury will be activated in the end to decide on the charges .	-6.1701
Nevertheless , setting up the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-4.2305
In the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.7824
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-1.8769
The issue gives Democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about ' .	-3.8653
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , stated in a statement that he did not know about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.5079
But they also usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-3.7091
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a fair way .	-3.2527
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not being investigated against the president .	-3.2831
There is no reason to assume that something has changed , the statement continued .	-5.5029
But Mueller had only been used after Trump fired Comey .	-7.0086
Because of this robbery , accusations had been made against Trump that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary .	-4.4823
Comey told a senate committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser , Michael Flynn .	-3.5186
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.5042
After presenting US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff .	-3.3132
This triggered speculation about whether Trump would dismiss Mueller .	-10.2676
Unlike an independent Congressional special investigator , such as the Watergate affair surrounding the later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the president ’ s insistence .	-10.9259
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.9670
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday that the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily .	-3.9165
Antarctica : Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica	-1.7113
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has dissolved itself from Berlin ’ s almost seven-fold size .	-5.1986
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.4840
The more than one trillion tonnes colossus and 5800 square kilometres are now driving north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-5.3010
With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-3.5001
It does not pose a threat to people .	-2.9130
The extent to which climate change has played a role in demolishing the iceberg is unclear , according to research .	-3.6399
Overall , however , for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shells in the region , the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) has written in a factual background .	-4.9062
Many researchers believe that this can be linked to global warming .	-2.6337
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C shelf feast .	-4.8794
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.9159
As a result , it continues to grow into the sea and periodically breaks down . . . . . . . . . . , .	-11.2056
The Larsen C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-4.1227
To the north of this shelf , the balance of growth and abortion was disrupted a few a few .	-5.5947
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen wrote a complete shelf feast there .	-4.8151
There is a lot to be said for the Larsen-C shelf being in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-6.6499
In addition , the ice plate is under voltage and can disintegrate if a piece is cancelled at a key point .	-6.2585
The melting of skelf and iceberg does not increase sea levels , as they swim on the water and crowd out ice as much water as it produces after melting .	-5.9528
However , the loss of the bowl causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before .	-5.0103
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , the British research project to observe the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.4528
According to AWI data , the Larsen-C shelf festival is the fourth largest shelf festival in Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.2645
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean about 200 meters .	-3.9275
It periodically breaks off there .	-3.4126
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.7888
" This is the widest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-3.3089
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen-C shelf will grow again or retreat in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.9509
But this will take decades .	-1.7857
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , many ice shells in the Antarctic Peninsula have disappeared in recent decades .	-4.5147
This long Antarctic tip stretches towards South America .	-2.6516
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.1171
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-3.0071
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed about three degrees over the past 50 years and is thus one of the areas where temperature is rising fastest .	-4.5109
CDU wants household rates for staff .	-4.0791
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions , the CDU is demanding that it leave the employers ' association to become more attractive .	-4.5797
Just before the summer recess , the Creistag won 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.9506
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.5093
Now , 17 trainees have passed their first day of work .	-4.9858
The teaching places at the circle are obviously very desirable .	-5.2685
Around 620 applications were available for the seats to be awarded this year .	-3.6614
Nevertheless , the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks . and .	-11.8065
Currently there are still 50 unoccupied jobs in the Mettmann district .	-3.8792
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are being sought .	-11.4299
The CDU now wants to take the initiative with the FDP and the UWG and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .	-6.0279
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration should ' develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development ' .	-5.6435
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers , but to counter the shortage of applicants in the future , it is said .	-11.3246
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , identify concrete measures for cross-border entrants and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-5.2061
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.2578
Because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that were previously unknown .	-4.9393
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.3502
We are talking about a genuine ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.4046
In addition , there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-4.5849
So it is high time to act so that more jobs do not go unfilled .	-5.0184
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , the leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.7762
He recently gave a fisting surprise in the Circle Day , when he publicly questioned the recruitment cover and amazed the other parties .	-7.4535
Peoples want to see all the possibilities that allow them to leave the municipal employers ' association to be examined . . . . . . . , , , . , .	-8.6752
" If we do not arrive at a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - should seek a domestic tariff , " says People .	-6.8925
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for the Public Service Tariford .	-5.8289
Currently , salaries are exactly compulsory , there are increases or more money only if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .	-7.0261
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown more and more in recent years .	-3.6104
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act .	-4.3437
Landrat Thomas Hendele and County Director Martin Richter have a problem , not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers : they have too few staff .	-5.2575
Italy is exacerbating the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats	-2.1038
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not continue unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.8688
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-7.8150
Minniti 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Save Assistance Organization because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.8674
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.7881
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-4.9886
'We can only judge all the accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-4.3823
The Italian authorities had monitored the Youth Save boat , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.9463
It is suspected that his crew will take hose boat migrants who are delivered directly to them by human traffickers , and that smugglers will be able to leave so that ships can be reused .	-5.9743
At least such a meeting was supposed to take place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Public Prosecutor 's Act , the content of which was published by Italian media .	-4.3600
The occupation is suspected of overlooking the authority of the Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-4.0998
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .	-3.1901
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.5639
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not entail ' substantial changes or disabilities ' of their rescue actions .	-12.4752
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Laureate Organization is Doctors Without Bo( MS) .	-2.6344
Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.4198
" In recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-2.5642
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-2.9373
Rising and Trials	-1.4971
Nine Weiler Biker , the " Berlin outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-3.8038
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-10.8168
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.6845
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.2238
The first tour led to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-2.7839
It followed viewpoints , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the forest and the upper plains .	-6.6590
In the meantime , there have been continuous increases for which long trials rewarded .	-5.0454
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-2.9443
Again , lookout point ranked at viewpoint , combined with " flowing " trials and moderate climbs .	-5.9234
On the last two days many meters of altitude were again expected .	-5.1908
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks .	-2.4562
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed healing sole in the open air inhalation .	-3.6856
Neustadt was also controlled .	-3.1613
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .	-3.8961
Konsole statt Grasen - Bundesliga geräht sich für E-Sport geEE-SpE.	-11.4437
Are the sport stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future , rather than struggling over the stadium grass during wind and weather ?	-5.3897
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge high-speed tournaments included .	-4.1062
The first Federal League Associations , which are increasingly involved in this area , have recognized this .	-5.0828
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015 , later FC Schalke 04 followed , and last of all VfB Stuttgart , who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .	-5.1497
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB , " says Managing Director Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.9316
He is sure that " many clubs will rise on this train " .	-5.0067
Next weekend , the FIFA World Football Association in London organizes the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other .	-4.4895
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain and the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.3646
Also Robin Dutt sees great potential in e-sport .	-8.5457
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players .	-2.2236
" Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year-olds in particular that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52 year-old .	-6.2177
And : The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .	-3.5742
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , you could be much more present on these markets online than just sending the Federal League Team to Asia once a year .	-5.3177
What exactly is this about ?	-2.0745
In e-sports , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or just the FIFA soccer simulation are fought at competitive level .	-10.9150
As in normal sport , leagues have long established in which professionals compete against each other .	-4.1160
And in the 2022 Asia Games , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-3.4157
But is it a real sport ?	-2.5691
For many , the idea certainly needs to be used .	-4.2718
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the issue for a long time .	-4.1096
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne , e-sport is a sport because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.3440
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid response capability .	-3.1201
Professional gamers should not only train at the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .	-3.7212
'The fit player is a good player ' .	-1.7000
Frobous , however , also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-5.1019
Controls are difficult to perform in online games , and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport .	-4.5798
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative impact of e-sport .	-11.0692
Players are travelling internationally , like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.4062
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth for e-sport .	-3.6055
In 2016 , EUR 50 million had been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsoring and major tournaments .	-4.2830
In three years , sales will be 130 million .	-3.2340
That is little against the nearly EUR 2.4 billion of the Football Bundeslig.	-4.6438
However , e-sport is " no longer far away from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , write the Deloitte consultants .	-4.6837
Many countries are already further international .	-2.8533
Large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.7274
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn .	-2.0817
There is also something happening in Europe .	-3.4192
E-sport has been introduced as a teaching facility in a Norwegian school , says Frobous .	-3.9025
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , the first football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.5739
" In comparison with Europe , Germany lags behind , " explains VfB Board of Directors Röttgermann .	-3.3830
Nostalgia alone , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough today .	-6.2318
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company in the modern market .	-9.5443
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.1425
'It is impossible to insist that only football remains as it has always been . '	-5.4454
Toxic eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking	-2.9481
The scandal over toxic eggs has now affected almost all the federal states .	-4.1398
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all eggs out of sale throughout Germany .	-3.1165
The shelves should only be taken into the shelves with eggs that are proven not to contain a fipronil .	-7.8344
Michelle Carter condemned the texts that urge Conrad Roy to suicide .	-4.2593
A Massachusett woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to suicide through texts and calls .	-2.9614
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been suspended .	-3.3271
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing by Conrad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .	-2.4278
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is uncomfortable .	-2.4854
My son was my best friend . '	-0.9848
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .	-2.5198
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .	-3.4203
Carter was dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse , with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downwards eyes when condemned .	-4.7229
" Your actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.9907
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-2.2627
She has taken no responsibility , " she said .	-2.5759
'She has not shown any repentance ' .	-3.0561
But Carter 's lawyer said that it was a ' terrible circumstance that she totally regrets ' .	-3.6713
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not discover that their ' age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant influence on their actions ' .	-4.1721
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , who said that " there is no day when I am not mourning the loss of my beloved son .	-3.5859
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything .	-4.4888
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " by the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children .	-4.2682
" No longer having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-4.5652
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-5.6538
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.3058
The case attracted national attention after Carter revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-2.6159
" Hang up , jump from a building , soak up yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-5.0324
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : ' You have to do it , Conrad ' and ' All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-4.2175
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .	-3.4718

Joshua Kimmich : Learn about the new mini-lamb of the FC Bavaria .	-3.1649
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as a captain at the Audi Cup .	-3.3899
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation doesn 't hurt .	-4.5687
Something was different in his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw , even though the additional clothing was very , very small .	-4.6006
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to be seen , he stopped the allocated bond .	-5.9027
" The coach did not announce it , " said the Confed Cup winner afterwards , after his first bet as Bavarian captain .	-3.9909
Well , the object could have been better than 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.8139
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-3.9939
Not the eight-year older Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a guide in the C-Elf , which was made up of youth players , debutants and professionals who have just come out of holiday , but rather he .	-12.5622
Sugar is most likely to be distributed to those who are very familiar with whom one wants to keep mood . .	-6.8461
Those who were chosen to enter the heritage of lamb can only use a small extra motivation .	-4.4182
Kimmich confirmed : " That is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-3.0951
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old fled over the field as a mini-lamp .	-3.1241
On the right , this is now his position , the white tie on the arm did the rest .	-4.4323
And Kimmich looked like the one who can best handle the rudder in this starting format .	-7.4772
He gave instructions to try to steer the unrecorded force .	-4.4028
He had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .	-4.0240
Vidal with overplaying his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Renato Sanches with joining devils to the achievements of the Asian journey ( even unconditionally ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not noticing negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian trikot .	-7.4828
After all , that was a good thing .	-4.4417
Süle ran alongside Kimmich , Rudy before defense , both acted sovereign .	-3.3694
The renowned Napoli storm often struggled , and souls also tried to succeed a few times in building the game .	-7.4470
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was ' not the way we hoped for ' .	-3.5120
But he also showed a good performance during the debut .	-3.8606
Game relocation , Tempo Change : " I was taken for this style " .	-6.1651
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entries was watched after the match .	-5.4037
For example , Rudy did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but certainly six or seven interviews .	-3.0270
Kimmich , after a couple of cracky statements , decided to leave the back of his new players .	-6.7087
There he heard an interesting sentence from the south : " I have already noticed what is going on here .	-4.7079
In Bavaria you just have to win every game " .	-3.2042

Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economics praises Wissings Tempo	-3.4478
It was often unreconcilable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.6327
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-3.5145
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .	-4.7453
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-3.8970
Natus sees the biggest reversal in infrastructure policy : the gap in motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s priority list .	-5.9186
Even this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure , and by 2021 the construction law will stand .	-6.4660
The West bypassing Trier also plays a role in the country ’ s plans , which is in the pressing need of the federal transport plan .	-5.9342
The goal is to start the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.1301
Natus sees it as a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.9566
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been backing off for ten years .	-6.0609
In addition , knowledge has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , praises the IHK .	-4.2185
The chamber of craftsmen Trier sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.7158
A premium of 1000 euros is foreseen for the existing master exam and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master training .	-6.0041
The homework list for the country , however , remains a long one . . . . . . . . , , , , . .	-10.6495
In the planned road construction , facts should be created quickly , while the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , head executive of the IHK Trier .	-6.3959
Of 56 new engineers , who want to hire knowledge in the country ’ s Mobility business , only 29 jobs have been occupied .	-6.8340
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .	-2.2105
CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf points out that the Court of Auditors calculates that in 2017 and 2018 , the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in maintaining country roads than proposed .	-5.1068
Frank Natus also expects a country ’ s concept of how to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.3243
The country 's broadband expansion to date is also sobering .	-5.4402

Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash against reaction .	-3.8024
One day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.4381
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than travel restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-4.6106
On Tuesday , Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.6011
None of the companies described the company as a recall .	-3.2972
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules .	-3.2886
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.0261
The cost for automotive manufacturers to install plants to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.9917
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.2598
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called switchgear that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested but decreased in normal driving conditions .	-5.7180
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.1063
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.3054
The former manager , Zacceo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-3.2275
Earlier this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the Audi authorities accused of installing a system to bypass emission regulations in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was extended .	-4.4794
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.5735
This message was the raft on Saturday on the Isar .	-3.8441
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.6243
In order for the visitors of Isar to participate , there is a raft through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .	-6.9082
Those who take it to the Isar again on Saturday will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbach bridge .	-5.1867
And this is not a usual raft , with Isar tourists .	-3.5387
The construction department wants to clarify .	-5.2355
On the raft you can see a large amount of information transparency .	-4.4838
It shows a garbage mountain .	-2.3579
The start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors .	-3.6218
With the motto " True Love is ... " the understanding of the Isar is intended to sharpen as a protective wild river .	-4.6042

Mordillos Knollennase and Laughter Against the Laughter	-3.6779
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon drawers , the noses of his figures are his trademark .	-4.2622
Also with 85 the Argentinian still draws and works on a film .	-4.1304
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.1988
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.7347
In the first years as an artist he was among other things a drawer for congratulations cards - which frustrated him .	-5.7555
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost , " he once said .	-2.1720
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.3412
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.2380
Time and again the artist of cities was inspired .	-2.7821
Large , round mordillo figures are stunning in drawings with the slate tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.2704
In the early morning , according to his own figures , he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .	-5.2225
Through calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , T-shirts , plush animals and watches , his drolling figures continue to be widespread worldwide .	-5.8100
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters .	-4.0850
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos 's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as opponent .	-3.4298
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .	-5.1356
" I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.3763
The script is not written by him .	-1.6035
This is why he is more relying on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wordless .	-5.7076
Provence ’ s Lavender Threat to Climate Change	-3.0718
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.1122
The lavender is declining due to drought conditions and insects transferred to diseases , causing great headaches to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions .	-4.9510
Eric Chaisse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn .	-4.6437
This affects the life of lavender .	-2.2859
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.7597
And there is much at stake .	-1.8799
Lavender oil is not only attractive for holidaymakers , it is also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics .	-3.7781
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.7914
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.0911
The solutions that are being considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of soil evaporation , but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dry .	-4.9431

The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-1.7665
Riodoce 's weekly newspaper staff usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials , and constant drug wars .	-4.7597
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-8.0612
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.0045
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , who in 2009 were the target of an attack on grenades or leave them at home .	-5.1706
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.5284
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed , perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient .	-3.5305
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s payroll or cartel , a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-9.7005
There is no break from violence , and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 ; 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.4721
Among the latter are their editor and inspirator of Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.0566
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .	-2.8416
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-4.9643
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-3.1531
Although a special lawyer has been set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on Journalists , it has only begun two criminal proceedings .	-4.8262
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists rarely bring the killers to justice .	-3.9209
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are uncomfortably and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous .	-4.8801
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-3.1285
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.9263
'As long as we do not know why , we distrust everyone ' .	-3.0238
In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan .	-2.9909
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his , and , , , , . , , , . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-13.1754
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.4678
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.7156
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.0851
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan .	-1.6262
But there is virtually nothing but silence about Valdez .	-2.3114
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country , with rival groups fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.4767
There is nothing to suggest that in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot on the streets every day , or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living .	-5.1062
Forget for a minute that there is a state of calm when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-3.8087
Nonetheless , and despite Valdez ’ s awareness of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .	-3.7802
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.2958
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.1659
This release may have annoyed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.3687
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the seizure of another newspaper , which had published the same story .	-3.4665
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-7.6476
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.0451
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , merging with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $ 50 in shares .	-4.6552
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-3.0841
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.3221
Reporters loved publishing tough investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.4454
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-3.2643
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it led .	-3.9039
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.2563
" I want to continue living , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.4259
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life " , he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV .	-2.4270
" You have to take on the task you are a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-5.1813
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.4139
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird who could curse like a port worker , the friend who was generous with embraces and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.1331
They trusted on his routine .	-2.0613
He would always wear his hat .	-1.5113
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .	-2.4043
Now they ask : was his love for routine his corruption ?	-7.7233
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive .	-3.5408
" You don 't like to deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to move drugs .	-4.6395
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.6921
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-1.9945
Trust his own instincts .	-1.7038
If it smells wrong , stay away from it .	-2.5133
The trouble is , said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal , that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier " .	-3.4418
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.3809
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.0039
In the space where Riodoce ’ s staff met for security training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed , and days were known to to to to to . to to to . to to to . to to to . to to . to . to . to . to . to . . to . to . to . to . . . , to . to . to to	-33.4909
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 degrees C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.6509
They were commissioned by the government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-3.7580
Half in joke , some reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of police officers who the governor himself called untrustworthy .	-3.4316
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.9360
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has clicked on three main stories .	-3.7557
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.1886
They also had an exposé on government spending , which focused on the governor ’ s home city .	-3.6604
And there was a group that kidnapped one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office .	-3.5310
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite place of drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.3696
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century .	-3.2164
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption .	-2.4438
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.0915
Only a few months earlier , the readers would have seen Valdez ’ s column as the most informed source of abduction .	-4.2145
" In the past we knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body status .	-3.7701
'Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken . '	-2.8303
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because the staff have become something they would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.5811
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor . . in in in .	-6.1868
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.9479
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.1360
Journalists throughout the country have become more vocal by writing " SOS Press " on walks and buildings in organized protests .	-3.5499
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-3.6499
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out and killing journalists because they said the truth .	-3.2985
She has since asked for it to be redivided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-4.3247
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organized crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .	-2.4454
In his last book , " Narco-Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organized crime .	-5.2180
Last year , the Articulo 19 media guardian group allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials .	-3.7384
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.0796
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-1.9644
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.0659
Their body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' I am here because of my reports ' .	-3.3161
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separated head .	-1.9339
Some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.7160
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .	-3.0091
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page entitled ' What do you want of us ? '	-4.1912
Some journalists have fled from their own countries or even from the country .	-2.9471
It is a painful decision .	-0.8485
It is hard to find work in exile and they are still watching the roads and looking for dangers .	-2.8396
And sometimes they are hunted , as the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.6824
For those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky choices .	-3.0790
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking frightens him .	-2.5651
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.3149
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Riodoce sat on the pavement in front of the office and drink beer when all their phones began to sum up .	-4.1992
A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-3.4754
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region .	-1.8379
From the edge of the boarding stone , they published the news on the Riodoce website on mobile phones .	-5.3690
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.6715
Sirens howled up nearby - another shooting shop in the area .	-3.3077
Bojorquez gave a look at the police who held guards to see if they were ready .	-3.0892
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-2.0230
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa , the staff of Riodoce followed his traces .	-4.2086
" How can you just remember closing it , " said Bojorquez , " when the intern asked me to send it to the streets for reporting on Javier 's murder on the same day . "	-5.8489
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade his enemies .	-3.1686
At first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a terrifying one .	-2.6413
Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-4.7188
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a " troubled past " .	-4.6774
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " described him as " the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " " " . " " " " " . " " " " " "	-8.9600
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurians who lived in the middle of the ruling period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.7182
His incredibly well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-3.4628
According to reports in National Geographic , armored plant eaters are the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-4.1212
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-2.4739
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rocks , and decided to look more closely .	-8.8863
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.1797
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clump .	-3.3875
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.2237
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature can be seen .	-5.1452
'It will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . '	-3.9921
Researchers have discovered that , although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , this vegetable eater has probably been threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs .	-4.5154
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.4694
This would have allowed him to mix better in his environment and evade his enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-4.8179
The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurians family made headlines in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.6059
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-9.6552
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-10.2544
They discovered countershading , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.1304
Although the countershading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .	-4.8446
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat eating dinosaurs , that evolution favored concealing confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.3613
But most contemporary animals that use countershading - think of deer , zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this Nodosaurian was exposed to a genuine struggle for survival .	-4.3548
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the crude time must have been , " said Brown .	-4.0679
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.2831
Scientists continue to investigate the animal 's evidence of its life , including its preserved intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .	-4.2223
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was in a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .	-4.5718
At that time Alberta was as warm as Southern Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-2.8752
" This nodosaurian is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-4.5223
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it was in the early round time .	-4.9360
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you look a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . '	-4.9572
The crude time was a time when huge theropodes , meat-eating dinosaurs , which stood on two legs , crossed the earth .	-5.7449
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-3.2161
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .	-3.3876
Scientists whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was sank in the sea after death and mumified in mud .	-4.2161
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.6731
According to the museum , it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the snout to the hip .	-3.2731
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.6812
It contained two 20-inch peaks that ran from its shoulders .	-3.9339
Researchers believe that armored plant eaters were flooded through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .	-3.8741
But the dinosaur ’ s underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.8284
The petrified remnants of this special copy are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover bulky tank plates along the dinosaur .	-14.9421
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is rare as a profit in the lottery .	-11.5157
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-2.0271
Conceived remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-3.9821
His right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are sprayed up .	-4.5011
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.9637
In the thunderstorm : Mass carambolage on A8 : Many injured people	-8.4256
Fierce accident on the A8 on Thursday evening : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-4.2071
There are many injured , kilometre-long jams and gaffers .	-3.0248
On the Autobahn Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage in late Thursday afternoon .	-4.0910
According to the police , around 5 p.m. between the connections Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) during a thunderstorm , nearly 30 vehicles , including probably lorries , were interconnected .	-5.9239
There was no information about the exact number of injuries .	-3.7653
These are slight to medium serious injuries , said a police spokesman .	-3.5774
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .	-3.4970
The A8 in the direction of Munich has been completely closed .	-3.6540
In the direction of Munich a restructuring of about ten kilometres was formed .	-5.7242
As an AZ reporter reports , there have been massive disabilities on the counter-road , with many gaffers .	-5.6725
The fire brigade listed the trademarks of the vehicle controllers , who are now facing sensitive penalties .	-5.0209
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.5882
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car .	-11.0935
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-2.6962
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.8628
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing knowing you sit in the train and sleep .	-4.6524
Or you are deeper in your work and have a brilliant idea .	-3.9264
And then : bufff .	-1.0242
Come the creator and wake up a smooth or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-4.5291
Ticket control .	-1.5477
But the times of interruptions are soon over .	-3.2362
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the ineffective ticket control .	-3.5727
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and devalue the ticket .	-5.1699
A test operation is currently running on two routes .	-10.8740
" If the offer arrives , we expand it .	-3.7092
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany early next year , " said a railway spokesman .	-14.3953
" Comfort Check-in " is the name of the railway for the devaluation of tickets without an operator .	-7.0539
In order to use them , however , a few requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-5.1811
And you have to book an online ticket - which is what most passengers already do .	-3.3240
You also have to use the train app which DB Navigator bought , which is the most convenient way to book tickets .	-5.2985
Last but not least , you need a seat reserv.	-2.8880
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.7529
A button for electronic devaluation appears for test customers .	-3.4162
The train attendants will receive a message to their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked Y seat .	-5.2163
When the train companion arrives at Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket that has already been devised .	-6.0337
So you can go on sleeping , continue working , remain silent .	-4.7178
The " Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should be used by passengers .	-4.3396
" If you want to travel by our train accompanying staff without ticket control , simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator .	-5.4610
This enables passengers to personalize their travel time by train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Fernwerk .	-4.8554
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-4.0548
Those who often travel by train know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the greatest troubles .	-5.1337
Often you yourself , but in any case one of the travellers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets .	-6.1603
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or any other document you have to present .	-5.2220
The result is endless discussions between train accompaniment and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the department or large space and delays in controlling their own ticket , and ultimately takes time for the creator to take care of other concerns .	-7.0100
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-2.5185
And this only applies to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections .	-3.0441
Further train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated .	-3.3606
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-2.0372
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.2697
Just one day after she arrived in New York City , the Born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.6536
She stumbled on a post from someone from the High School .	-2.5592
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the streets , " it said .	-3.4254
Confused because nobody else posted the information on their feed , they closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.8874
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah has been continuously retweeted on their timeline .	-3.3358
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old , killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-8.9740
He posted a picture of Brown ’ s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .	-4.3084
" That 's wild , " Ferrell thought .	-2.8441
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.7847
She departed her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later in the evening .	-4.5269
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who took a sign with the inscription : ' Ferguson 's police have just killed my unarmed son ! '	-5.1274
She observed a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belly dog .	-5.5402
In another video , she said , another policeman detained his gun and shouted : ' I will kill you ... animals all ' .	-3.4261
" This is not common , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-3.1781
'This is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to and which we can call typical ' .	-3.9469
At this moment I felt shaking frost .	-2.1588
I was angry and crying . '	-1.6918
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-2.2377
After landing at 11 p.m. she picked her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-3.9691
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in cinemas from 11 .	-3.5343
It is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that consists of the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.0317
When Ferrell and her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown , went to Ferguson , they discussed a conversation that they had » about the black experience and the black state <unk> countless times before this morning .	-5.1140
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " she remembered what she said .	-2.9443
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.0195
I could not take them with me , " said Ferrell later .	-2.4119
" What happened today is a peak of what happened in the past .	-2.1930
They need to know it and see it and be raised in it .	-4.0026
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves .	-3.8879
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blatant racism , she is no different from the next black woman child .	-4.8125
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it . '	-3.6919
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp site when activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.8814
Ferrell and her daughter have joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-4.0011
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.9346
Slowly , a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-2.2959
" My activism changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.4332
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.5687
Everything has come . '	-1.7963
Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.5808
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.5799
Ferrell asked one question : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-4.1288
This scepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often by whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.6793
As Folayan recently stated in an interview , ' We had heard that people born and grew up in Ferguson did not center their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.8190
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death ract passengers .	-3.5528
Ferrell 's commitment brought the project closer , together with six other locals followed the team of Whose Streets ? in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-5.0878
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us .	-2.9511
'That was the main thing for me , as these people are portrayed , because that is how I will be portrayed . '	-4.8876
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.1160
As a result , documents from Whose Streets show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-3.0219
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-10.6757
'But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people ' .	-3.7572
In addition , Ferrel ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement .	-3.0850
Two of the three founders of the movement , who , following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , marked the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.1468
" Black , gay women in management positions have supported the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-5.0283
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.2422
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is truly maintained by black women and many black women " .	-8.5734
She insists , however , that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.6834
" She was the person shaking up this energy , " she said .	-2.9025
" It is no coincidence , although she was on the front line , because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman , so much is at stake .	-4.8716
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.2594
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue .	-3.4278
Ferrell is on suspension for 2 <unk> years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.7163
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-3.3870
Nevertheless , she clings to a singing and feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-5.4653
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.0228
It is our duty to win .	-0.9577
We must love and support each other .	-1.3724
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-2.0669
From " Dream " to " Grö<unk>enmahn " : TV readers discuss bit-gallery .	-3.4062
The bit gallery moves people , although it is far from being built .	-3.6382
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.6148
Cold , the subject hardly leaves anything .	-4.3837
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-3.0018
While some say to the bit gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really classic " ( Nicole Showers ) , comes from the other side : " Don 't need a human being " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Gro<unk>enwahn ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-5.8569
While proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , which also benefits the rest of the shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed .	-5.5797
In addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the site where the farm market hall is located , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.1614
This will stop at the beginning of the construction work .	-3.6191
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside .	-3.9698
Simone Zimmer : " We have been buying in the farm market hall for many years .	-10.9860
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are always very happy .	-4.6667
We have also discovered the butcher for us .	-2.9682
We would like to see this offer maintained during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-3.9362
There are also other cities .	-3.3793
The small market hall in Frankfurt in particular is interesting . '	-2.6312
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .	-3.5889
However , this should not be very low in the new project ' .	-4.7384
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-2.2235
Whether clothing , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-2.9154
There are enough of them in our city .	-3.6048
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.5193
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall .	-4.7160
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly offered by the producer and are also inexpensive .	-4.6943
As you can see , stores in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , because the rents there are often not acceptable to a retailer .	-5.5734
It is a pity that there are almost no more special deals and what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-5.3096
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall doesn 't fit for me .	-2.6731
And the gallery doesn ’ t fit into Bitburg .	-7.0938
Above all : where should the farm market hall go during the construction period ?	-3.9016
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-4.0955
Or does the Ghost Bit Gallery manage to sell all shops from Bitburg in advance ? ' ? ? ? . . . . . . . . . . . .	-13.4730
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-2.1402
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-3.0826
I think it would have been better to promote a real farming market instead of this gallery .	-3.4101
However , thanks to the madness of many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg , there is no place for a farm market hall .	-5.8015
If the farm market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-3.5377
A suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA DNA .	-2.9672
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost unnoticeably the same - that hang on cables from the ceiling .	-4.2441
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.4396
Manning sent the sections from Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making public diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website classified as secret .	-4.9239
The new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable similarity ) .	-3.1533
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combined its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he was only three days in office .	-4.7097
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data , has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only on the form of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.0066
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six infringements of the Spionage Act , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.1555
The prison oppressed her image so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black-and-white selfie , in which manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated .	-6.1754
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.6621
In it , the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette mud and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like .	-4.2089
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-7.7793
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition .	-3.5804
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so contact Chelsea and ask her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.4335
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letters , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-4.3375
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which anticipated a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would transform and would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.0332
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama ’ s demand for Mannings ’ release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.7840
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to escape further the rigid divisions that he should fix .	-17.3317
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-2.5827
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning demanded an end to ' automatic fragmentation , the foundation of which was gender , race , sexuality and culture ' with its oversized signature ( the ' i ' in her family name is given a heart ) .	-6.3897
On the opposite wall , their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-2.9088
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-3.4944
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose 2007 video work , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-3.7082
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so 30 of these stories are . "	-2.9027
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .	-3.8733
She shows manning how she appears with a free phone in her hands from the disciplinary barracks of the United States such as King Kong .	-4.9593
" When they cold your speech , they won " , it says .	-3.7976
" So never stop the mouth " .	-1.9492
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist greeting from Philadelphia .	-2.7731
'I still get goosebut when I talk about it ' .	-4.0015
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by her own genomic simulacrs , which are like hordes of protesters .	-6.6916
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings stature ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-4.5783
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.6394
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . '	-3.6399

The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-2.0321
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-3.2098
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.5632
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the place of events , and detectives investigate the stings as murder , while the police actively seek for the two suspects , said officials .	-4.2996
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.1674
Alan K. Cubbage , the Vice-President of University Relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now in vain and was excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University .	-4.6126
" This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.6059
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-7.8968
A University and Somerville College spokesperson said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way ' .	-4.7776
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .	-4.9099
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he urged suspects to face the authorities .	-2.6993
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them are intensifying , " said Guglielmi .	-2.9344
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-1.8187
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in Apartment 1008 .	-3.5304
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9790
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.1349
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.4554
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.5551
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to the inhabitants : ' The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . '	-4.2079
" We will complete the WADA Roadmap in the near future " - Russian Vice-Premier Mutko .	-7.7712
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) to be implemented .	-2.8870
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road map , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.6693
The WADA Roadmap has been updated in this respect , " Mutko said on Thursday .	-2.7538
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization 's website .	-4.4226
According to Mutko , it does not contain anything that could cause concern to Russia .	-3.2317
" Everything was announced , everything is implemented .	-2.4144
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.1086
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.3045
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : " We are carrying out the investigation , because our anti-doping system has acknowledged a mistake .	-9.9596
All of the measures have been implemented .	-10.0240
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-3.2556
Mutko ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission .	-2.6610
In discussions with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organisations , but added : ' We repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.9299
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally , ' added Smirnov .	-2.7787
RUSADA was excluded from the conduct of doping controls in Russia during the doping scandal of the WADA in November 2015 .	-3.8759
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.4862
After a visit to Moscow 's headquarters in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA moved " in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-3.6142
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being .	-2.3304
The group of companies shared this with us .	-9.3238
It is a purely precautionary measure that no health impairment can continue to be assumed , as the communication said .	-6.3680
From now on , only eggs will be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fitronil-containing anti-licking agents .	-6.8399
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers .	-4.3482
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next user .	-3.1912
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e-commerce start-up , but the polls did not work .	-11.8782
Answers were often vague , little helpful or , worse , fraudulent .	-2.5677
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.5397
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who operates the 75 person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed .	-2.8396
She called for help from outside people .	-2.8766
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.2682
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and address directly to the Board of Direc.	-5.3282
" You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee commitment .	-3.4588
Errett said that they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with glind .	-3.5238
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance what units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill back why .	-5.1287
Companies come to realize that they must remain at the forefront of the workplace culture , so that you do not become the next user involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished .	-5.2687
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.7465
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could be worth more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website Let 's Talk Payments .	-2.5567
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit .	-3.9574
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.4991
Uber recently registered as a client .	-2.0372
Like Glint , Convercent allows companies to send customized " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of their problem areas .	-4.2146
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-2.8379
And if the principal executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-9.5794
" Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent , has captured the regulators .	-4.8308
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott , worker fluctuation , and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.3251
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .	-4.5826
Earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.9111
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .	-2.9525
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practices , can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-5.3632
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who leads Ruby Tuesday 's Risk Management Group .	-4.1193
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-3.1013
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.7530
But it took the " social media to get their right " to recognize that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online .	-4.9381
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.6159
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and impose recurring charges on companies to use their products .	-3.4275
It is a business model and an opportunity that receives the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups .	-3.7302
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising total capital to $ 47 million .	-3.0829
Glitzer secured $ 10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $ 60 million .	-3.1579
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.6144
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today 's employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-12.2348
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only wages .	-2.6395
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.3671
" If people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices , and that the work you do is worth , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.8931
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are involved and committed .	-5.4231
If third party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee commitment , it is no wonder you will find support .	-4.5851
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture important .	-3.3615
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-3.7336
Indeed , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.5393
And if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees .	-4.5843
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on data collection .	-3.9299
" For if you do not follow staff will ask , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.6688
Do you care about this ?	-2.8290
Who do not care about this , why should I ? '	-9.1438
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on glint , says Errett .	-4.0291
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication .	-4.7732
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is constantly gaining new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this will lead to better links between workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.5090
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.2006
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-2.0552
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.2671
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-2.9966
It ’ s going on at 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .	-5.8799
Some have pulled out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.1466
For a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .	-2.5490
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 .	-5.3088
" This is a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.9774
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.1740
Therefore , the first three UCLA training courses should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed timetables of the players .	-5.6619
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood conducted practical exercises .	-4.8406
In the course of August 18 exercises are to be held , 20 before the formal preparations for their opening against Texas A & M in September .	-6.3355
Mora said that he supports the NCAA ’ s rule change , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .	-5.5387
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.8293
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to pluck , they are great people .	-4.6320
I think that as soon as we get to Saturday and have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.9157
UCLA will terminate its practices once the camp is finished , which , given the clear sights of its fields , will not be an easy task for adjacent parking and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been thrown with footballs that have cleared a safety net behind a peat post .	-8.0916
Bruin players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-3.9164
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.4693
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adapt to record an exercise there .	-4.7145
If you have the video band of an exercise , it 's a pretty good deal .	-3.4007
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking lot 8 .	-3.0265
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.3524
That is why I am not too concerned .	-10.6128
We have a plan . '	-0.8068
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit news .	-3.0973
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fact-checkers from third parties and then display their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-4.9276
In an opinion on its website , the company said that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify potential false messages and to send them to fact-verifiers who may display results of the fact-verification from the original article .	-5.7850
Facebook was criticized as one of the main points of distribution for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .	-4.2002
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful postings as they did before the September elections .	-4.0598
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.9412
" In addition to recognizing what stories are contested by fact-checkers of third parties , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for facebook messages in a blog .	-4.8700
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages .	-3.3870
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.1311
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.5457
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaar Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-3.9889
" I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says painfully .	-3.4919
'What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hands ' .	-2.3217
" A Castle in England " covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-4.3061
It is not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .	-3.0350
" I only reacted to the thumbnail on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-3.9673
" That is his thumb print !	-2.5470
And letters always smell for smoke , because at that time they lit a fire because of light .	-4.3750
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were himself . .	-4.7423
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.4776
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued my welcome greeting " ) , all this seems too beautiful to be true .	-5.6957
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hyene heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the moat .	-4.1646
He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , talking to landscapers , gardeners and sometimes also to the artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-4.4982
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and started writing " .	-2.2620
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last Erbin , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.1519
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees only began to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the attic " .	-3.9855
Diaries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to struggle for the two families .	-5.0057
Boys , let everything go ! '	-2.0145
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the rural uprising of 1381 .	-5.0084
" There is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-2.7248
" The farm revolt began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-3.2810
Perhaps the two are interconnected ? '	-2.4548
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit pattern that the Darrell family hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.2666
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which portrays the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-3.9806
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite Scotney family : " The lords seemed to be pretty guys , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-5.2243
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to promote eradication . ' ' . to to .	-6.3948
After the end of his work in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-3.5266
He has passed a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-4.4650
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.6039
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.4043
It was like ' Oh , now I have to cope with the damned life ' .	-3.9385
Campaign launched : More than 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf hidden behind .	-4.4469
With the covering of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign for the launch of a new roof brand ( Thursday round show ) on Friday .	-5.1100
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .	-2.4752
At the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-3.8550
" Too good for us .	-2.1540
Or ? " , the makers of the action since yesterday asked on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel .	-4.4170
" We don 't really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their website yesterday .	-4.4562
" But we use this measure to attract your attention .	-1.9715
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems .	-2.3590
Basically , we are firmly convinced that we , as Bad Honnefer citizens , are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-3.6303
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it continues .	-3.3164
" A single promise must be formulated , one that gives the city a distinctive single-mindedness feature " . " " . " " " " " " " " " " "	-9.3559
After all , they compete with other municipalities .	-2.2594
The city of Bad Honnef has a middle five-digit amount to cost its new umbrella brand and campaign .	-5.8309
Military Reform in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-2.2401
Every year at the beginning of August the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and transportation in the officer corps .	-3.8010
So , too , this week .	-2.3630
At first glance a normal procedure .	-1.7339
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.4025
The sitting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as was previously the case , but in the Prime Minister ’ s office .	-11.2358
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government , the five Vice-Premiers , as well as the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and External Action , have now taken part in the discussions .	-4.4548
Thus the civilians in the YAS were in the majority .	-3.8759
The government is attracting the reins in the military .	-2.3379
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the air forces and the navy have been dismissed .	-4.6531
Since the failed coup , Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.3162
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army 's ranks , mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who Erdogan sees as the wire donor of the coup attempt .	-4.5734
About 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara this week .	-3.5681
Already the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt a " God 's Gift " , giving him the opportunity to " clean the armed forces completely " .	-6.1679
But is Erdogan really in control of the army ?	-2.3093
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in the military headquarters " .	-2.6645
In the general staff , there are concerns about the increasing " Islamization " of the army , which is manifesting itself , among other things , in the lifting of the banning of headscarves for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-5.8217
In any case , the grand cleaning of the army and the security forces continues .	-5.2610
In mid-July , Erdogan had another 7395 civil servants fired by decree , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.8159
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military .	-2.7179
The generals were used earlier than the country ’ s actual masters .	-4.0541
Three times they were putting their role as guardians of the secular state order .	-4.8833
Following his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan step-by-step pushed back the military ’ s power , not least by calling for the European Union ’ s reform requirements .	-5.4833
Former officers say that Erdogan is driving forward targeted Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.4775
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a nominally unnamed officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad , warned that the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' time .	-4.4792
If so , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-3.1640
In any case , after the cleansing of the alliance , there are doubts about the Turkish army ’ s willingness to act .	-4.0168
The management structures and operational capabilities are " weakened " , says NATO diplomats .	-3.0553
Washington amends the Green Card Rules	-1.9708
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , cited by the media .	-1.8827
It provides for reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas .	-3.8657
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-10.1135
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-2.8524
'This law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are spent Green Cards . '	-3.7265
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.4582
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-3.5969
Ministry wants to renovate track for racetrack shuttle .	-4.4045
Over the past few months , the future of the racetrack huttle has been disputed again and again - now it is to be done very quickly .	-7.6252
Before the end of the year , it is planned to be built on the marvelous route on which the tourist railway runs .	-6.4202
In order to ensure the future of the racetrack shuttle in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will start this year .	-5.3519
" By deciding to continue to order and rehabilitate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this connection , which is particularly important for tourism , " said Klaus Sühl , Transport State Secretary , on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.0941
The cost of repairing the route was about EUR 2.5 million .	-3.3466
The country is accounting for 75 % of this sum .	-4.2318
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being finalised , declared Sühl .	-4.9577
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operators already agree on the technical details .	-3.7425
" This negotiates the timetable , the vehicles used and the quality standards , " said Sühl .	-3.4979
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-2.9775
The race shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-3.2208
The racetrack shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig , especially . . . . . . . . . . . . , , ,	-13.1511
Over the past few months , a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future .	-6.2530
The route is also partly due to decline .	-4.3359
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned about it .	-2.6154
Precisely when you thought that it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .	-9.1615
Yes , indeed .	-1.2330
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment .	-1.9279
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.0018
According to Noel Sharkey , Emeritized Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and FRR co-founder , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.2348
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of fingernail .	-3.6801
" People are funny about them , but companies are delivering a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently , " said Mr. Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-5.4086
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.5436
The user can also " adjust " his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the robot 's eye color to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his fingernails . .	-4.9123
But it becomes even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " that would make a Stepford woman look progressive .	-3.9919
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.8926
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as shepherd .	-4.3987
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shyness and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-4.2387
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible , " swarms the website of True Companion .	-3.2754
So she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc .	-2.3120
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-4.1032
It can be tired , fixed on conversation , or it can be ' in mood ' !	-3.4062
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics , the allusions to rape , when you go a step on Frigid ( i.e. , reluctant ) Farrah , worry one most one .	-5.7088
On his website True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-1.8155
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " says the website .	-3.4519
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.9523
Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-3.8710
Most men will not , of course , hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes its rising popularity , they remain temporarily on the brink of consumer culture .	-4.2000
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.7452
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission .	-3.3042
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who boasted of having sexually attacked women .	-5.0567
The most deterrent aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the swallowed bodies and the outcast eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-4.7950
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-3.1211
The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with pornstar proportions ) .	-8.9258
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-3.0679
But , to the point when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots do not represent real women . . .	-4.4384
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or just go away .	-3.2402
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission .	-3.7486
In other words , they are happy slaves .	-1.7765
Or to put it in the 2017 speech : service girls	-6.8661
Trump ’ s Great Power ?	-1.2628
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense .	-1.8315
It has become a trump era ’ s binding wisdom that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided small families .	-4.9017
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival , there have been newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the Trump horror of relatives electing .	-4.6710
We are all supposedly trying to burst our filter bubbles .	-8.2033
Less noticed has been Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.4106
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me in New York this week .	-3.2372
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect on a common enemy .	-2.2306
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republican kinship she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and quite strange on the same side .	-3.7660
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is also striking to me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-6.4211
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s disastrous effect has the strength to push us all to the right .	-11.7841
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the horrific possibility that one day his girls will no longer reject us .	-4.9643
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump " normalizes " right-wing Republicans , who suddenly seem to be the embodiment of reasonability compared to his standards .	-4.9070
I find myself afflicted today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urcomic version of the madman – the dog on the roof , which is 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like ) – both of which , compared to Trump , actually occur as a very mild crime .	-6.7180
When Trump goes , the Republicans ’ next candidate must be mentally healthy only to qualify as an immense improvement .	-3.5785
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest carousel in the New York Park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-4.4900
The horses are enormously large , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurry and the animals twist to look at their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way .	-5.3743
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.4195
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great roundabout in northern London .	-4.0677
The Central Park Carousel , however , is still a strange magical experience , since two years of age , a 11-year-old and two women in the 1940s can go on and all have a great time .	-6.4441
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-3.5633
On the other hand , this week in a department store I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-4.0241
In the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to compare the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter table .	-4.5851
This not only results in a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no one is required .	-4.1045
The poor woman in the department store was apologizing grinning , while I was tired of having the experience of reaching her my five star credit card .	-5.2987
Oscar Pistorius , with breast pain from prison , moves to hospital .	-3.0680
For the second time , Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit .	-2.3473
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts at his wrist joints , which , according to the prison authorities , he suffered after a case in his cell .	-5.3566
Pistorius was sentenced for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence .	-3.5254
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine ’ s Day in 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria .	-4.2412
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who hid himself in the cabin .	-3.7372
Public prosecutors have announced their intention , this time , to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-4.2411
The National Law Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .	-3.8803
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .	-3.6113
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7317
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg	-2.5473
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the fourth grades from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed in the holidays and in the secondary schools .	-4.9912
Three of the discharge students will go to the gymnasium in the future , four to the real .	-5.4457
School manager Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-3.1821
As a symbol of school dismissal , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grows up in the Hehnerhof but is then released into freedom .	-4.8927
In addition , the muntere Shar performed a musical entitled " Der Eagler im Hehnerhof auf " .	-5.6683
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it burst out from his chickens .	-3.9041
Instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .	-2.5506
But the hope of making him a chicken broke down , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared .	-4.4764
Then the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the classification of Yvonne Frank .	-3.7087
The hens danced with the young gockels who wore cylinders to the bet .	-3.0605
The eagle stands for integration , said school manager Angelika Sitte .	-2.1530
The kitten is different from the other kitten ( chicks ) , but belong to it .	-4.6680
But he will never be like a chicken .	-8.6058
Its purpose is to be free .	-2.3053
She wished every fourth graduate to feel accepted in his new school .	-4.0521
I would like to thank my fellow MEPs , former school leader Michael Müller , who continues to jump into teaching bottlenecks and parent representatives .	-6.0807
The cooling season is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-8.9400
She is very reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .	-5.2568
Finally , they have been able to rely on the fourth grades .	-4.5210
At the end , all the students had a song of summer time and holiday time .	-5.7522
In doing so , great joy broke out among the .	-14.1554
Eight first graduates have already been registered for the new school year .	-3.2844
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-0.8226
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .	-2.6367
On the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegal tenants in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.1247
On the same day they were released while an investigation is currently under way .	-9.8652
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released .	-2.4369
The Greek authorities have tightened up control of the free camp and impose substantial fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-11.3969
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.4703
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-2.3048
Software update for diesel vehicles : What those affected now need to know ?	-2.8115
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.6895
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?	-2.3660
The most important questions and answers at a glance .	-1.8746
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars .	-2.6147
They are intended to improve exhaust gas behaviour for cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and , in part , Euro 6 .	-4.7779
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt from this .	-3.0319
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :	-2.6288
Is the new action obligatory ?	-1.6433
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.2343
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have foam software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.6965
The Federal Authority ( KBA ) has arranged their retrofitting .	-4.3001
How and when are customers informed about updates ?	-2.1328
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet specified a precise date .	-4.2742
Daimler has announced that he will write to everyone concerned .	-4.5157
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .	-3.9833
How long will the overall changeover take ?	-4.2187
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin .	-2.8164
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure .	-3.0569
'We have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment ' .	-3.5680
How long should the update take ?	-1.7252
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.0222
Time consuming can be to get an appointment .	-3.1204
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.5109
The ACE advises you to wait .	-2.1738
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow up , says Smetanin .	-3.6809
Does a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars now threat?	-2.7963
The ACE fears that .	-1.2152
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten .	-3.1805
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.2870
ACE advises you to wait for a sale .	-2.5880
LL Cool J is awarded Kennedy Center Award .	-2.4814
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.4312
President Trump ’ s first award ceremony promises to become political .	-1.9099
One of the laureates does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.6998
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the most sought-after awards from the renowned Kennedy Centre .	-12.0196
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and television producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the honors .	-3.9984
The awards will be given at the beginning of December .	-2.1720
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania .	-2.7635
The award winner Lear , known with progressive TV series , has therefore already announced that he would not participate in the gala .	-5.3052
He said to the New York Times : ' This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that is a burden on me ' .	-5.1398
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.2730
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.5808
Earlier winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.1899
We make the city livable	-3.9340
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city builder , retires next year .	-3.6404
The job is already posted - suitable applicants are rare .	-3.6962
For 31 years Wacker has been the master of the city .	-4.0113
And the work still gives him great fun as he conveys in the press discussion .	-4.7524
He reports of varied but demanding tasks awaiting his successor .	-3.4733
At the same time , he is surprised that no application has so far fulfilled the requirement profile .	-3.5014
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer as soon as possible .	-3.5108
For example , while respecting the regular termination periods , there is still enough time to get involved .	-6.9082
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community , the Applicant must have the appropriate qualifications .	-5.9785
Because this function is what the city wants to retain .	-4.4837
If they were unable to fill them out , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.0510
But closeness to the citizens is important to the city and to him himself , says Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens .	-5.0517
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , with Wacker proudly looking back on .	-4.6509
" We make the city worth living " , he is sure of the building office and its staff .	-4.9052
In the future , however , diverse projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for instance , is starting .	-6.7420
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .	-3.4150
The latter alone will beat about EUR 1.5 million , " if we do it right " , Wacker estimates .	-4.4421
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.1741
Work here is fun . '	-1.8348
There is room for manoeuvre for a city master .	-4.9884
Haslach ’ s own Bauhof and Gärtnerei can respond to a lot of things quite flexibly .	-6.3981
" Much can be moved " , says Wacker , and the design of the green facilities is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-4.6574
Since the Old Town is an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to " have an eye for what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing master of the city stresses .	-6.1793
In any case , the master of the city has a high responsibility .	-4.9865
He is a builder , " in the end everything runs over my table " .	-3.4144
In the case of support and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been involved for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Depbau ) for 15 years .	-6.2945
Wacker also wants his successor to stay long : " We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the job " .	-5.3130
Continuity is important not only for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city .	-4.0375
Anyone who wants to acquire Roland Wacker should be able , according to the city of Haslach , to have completed studies as a diploma engineer or a bachelor with a specialist orientation architecture and have good expertise in the field of construction and construction planning law .	-8.9931
The City Building Office is subject to high and low-construction , construction management , basic employment , administration of urban properties , urban farm with Bauhof and urban gardening as well as Lower Building Law Office including monument protection .	-9.7905
Bicycle thrown on lines : Southern railway track locked off . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-10.3469
According to the police , the perpetrators hitherto unknown had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the Leobener Stra<unk>e area ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-4.9874
These were damaged so much that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-3.7674
The investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours .	-3.6580
Close to the Tatort , witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver .	-4.4821
" This goes far beyond a loudspeaker strike , " said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA .	-4.7866
The perpetrator or the perpetrators would have put himself in great danger and threatened rail transport .	-5.6694
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , the delay and the cost of rail replacement transport , pönals of rail customers could also be attacked by the perpetrators . .	-12.0762
Overall , one should assume a " significant " sum , said the speaker .	-4.5596
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , and rail traffic on the South Railway route could be carried without disabilities .	-4.8532
Nearly ten passenger trains had been dropped on Friday morning , two of which concerned long-distance transport .	-4.9977
Freight trains did not fall , but they were late .	-3.3859
According to <unk>BB spokesperson Christoph Posch , some 200 meters of upper lines had to be exchanged .	-3.3551
Insulators and masts have also been damaged .	-2.0484
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease ) .	-2.5196
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.5088
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases .	-3.1402
The incurable state of affairs , which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach forces and leaves , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-4.2942
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote tolerant intestine .	-3.5320
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate into the body .	-3.9459
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are offset by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .	-3.0301
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory disease .	-3.3831
In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in its insects .	-5.3853
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-2.7614
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacteria type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.7642
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells " .	-2.7367
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in Tryptophan promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal milieus when the same system also works in humans .	-5.4142
The postdoctoral landlord Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that a group of mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been housed separately , did not .	-5.4074
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal biomes of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.1114
The DNA sequenced the mice and six types of bacteria found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in the mice .	-6.7000
Mäuse were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a Darmmicrobiom and did not develop this type of immune cell , and they received the L. Reuteri and the immune cells .	-5.4135
In order to understand how the bacteria had an impact on the immune system , researchers L. reteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immune cells that were isolated from the mice .	-4.6524
The immune cells evolved into tolerance cells .	-3.0234
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as an indol 3 milk acid .	-3.6179
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice feed , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but when the tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.0324
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.8816
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to Tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory disease .	-4.1645
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.0750
Potentially , high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . '	-4.8085
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-2.0773
At Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes , after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-8.8136
The $ 40 million signature from Chelsea began with a $ 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed with the holder role , when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched as they like .	-4.7459
However , Matic had been excluded from the Blues Preparation Asia Tour and managed only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-5.2624
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.9479
'We will help him to be ready sooner than later ' .	-2.1387
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his Start-XI for the beginning of the season .	-3.9191
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to fulfil three of its four priority commitments .	-3.9204
" Three out of four , for which I thank the association , " he added .	-3.0323
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken a great deal of trouble . '	-4.1421
Boeing " paints " Dreamliner in the heavens	-7.2193
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.7294
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which is several thousand kilometres .	-4.8972
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.8802
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner .	-2.7997
The whole thing was a stamina test for new engines .	-2.2322
Boeing had already made such advertising .	-2.6944
The number " 787 " and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .	-2.7380
New deep blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem with a problem .	-3.0810
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still a SPD chief , Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-4.7470
Just no disturbance from the party headquarters , just no headwind from the federal government - that was the main wish of the election campaigners .	-6.5146
Since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.4649
Since then , the employees of the Willy-Brandt House have been watching events in the SPD ruled state capitals with growing horror .	-4.3564
What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds .	-4.0853
They were deep strikes .	-3.0765
One by one .	-2.1150
After the surprising end of the red green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens .	-3.7351
" This shows once again : Red Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber of the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.9660
The surprising exit of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil 's government ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.0952
Five months before the Landtag election , his red-green coalition thus lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP .	-6.1231
The German Green Chief Michael Kellner has asked the breakaway Dutch Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate .	-4.2389
Transferring to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate .	-3.5355
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the German Federal CEO and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.0924
" All this must not be true , " says an SPD campaigner , when on Friday morning the new message reaches the party headquarters .	-6.4519
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is here after the Green MEP Elke Twesten resigned to the CDU without a majority of government .	-5.0026
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .	-3.6955
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.7466
The misery began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-2.7035
A blue eye , no longer , the comrades at the time calmed down .	-3.8212
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.4757
That became even worse - and it all became much worse .	-5.7143
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the thumb , and the Düsseldorf bankruptcy slipped the party .	-5.2799
The comrades struggled again in the weeks afterwards .	-5.0379
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-3.2637
And with him came the next deep blow .	-2.4273
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmony while his city burned .	-4.0006
And because in crisis communications he made pretty much the wrong thing that can be done wr. .	-7.0932
Since then , Scholz has fought for his political survival .	-1.7934
So now Stephan Weil .	-2.5489
Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time .	-3.5844
Miss polls were added .	-2.9813
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Because in recent weeks has been increasingly trying to make accents in the covenant .	-7.1373
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden , either , in the area around Martin Schulz .	-5.5045
They granted him because they promised to stabilize the party from Because .	-3.2895
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-3.1135
Because of the partisan dispute between the Greens of the Lower Saxon , it is basically not to blame .	-6.2847
And Schulz is not .	-2.5324
For the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.7891
Her anger is directed at the Greens , and in particular at the dissenting parliamentarian , Mr Twesten .	-4.7858
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Bundestagsfraktion , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.3640
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the country list of the Greens of the Netherlands , according to the Lower Saxon Member .	-5.4624
The logical consequence would be for it to return its mandate .	-2.4842
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestag Group , laments an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.2842
" The electorate ’ s will four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil the prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Dutch SPD as a leader in the election , the RND .	-5.1361
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MEP distorts the election result , " said Oppermann .	-3.6307
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.8153
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been more pledges from the CDU of Lower Saxony .	-4.1227
Support money for town centre III	-4.5818
Anyone who wants to rehabilitate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .	-5.7155
On Wednesday , Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Municipal Development informed about this . . . . . .	-12.4160
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far .	-3.4415
Since 1991 there have been recovery areas .	-3.2335
Back then , in the reconstruction area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over another two-thirds of the funding .	-4.1438
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , grants were still 60 % .	-4.1760
For Schindler , the renovations to date are a " success project " - it is important , after all , to promote internal development and not just to open up new areas of construction .	-6.4916
On 4 April , the presidency of Karlsruhe gave the information that there will be a reconstruction area III .	-4.8866
The grant amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would be received from the country , the rest from the municipality .	-4.7643
How does a rehabilitation area come into being ?	-11.4292
They will continue to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-12.1591
It also has a role to play , however , whether there is any interest in rehabilitation in the planned area .	-4.5746
If necessary , the territorial boundaries could then be postponed again .	-4.4120
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.8446
Keller presented the contents of the Federal State Programme " Social City " , in which the rehabilitation would be carried out .	-4.8608
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .	-4.3761
The measures would be carried out object-related , i.e. per plot .	-4.6858
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .	-4.2811
The granting period for the grants has run until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-3.3913
Until September of this year , however , the stocktaking would be carried out in order to fill out a questionnaire for those involved in the recovery area .	-6.5008
In November or December , the Statutes Decision will take place as far as possible so that the rehabilitation can begin next year .	-5.4536
Pietzschmann then declared that each municipality must carry out the said preliminary investigations .	-4.3410
It is a question of assessing urban maladministration and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent .	-4.2251
A reconstruction notice will then be entered in the land register for each property .	-6.9272
Pietzschmann will come back to reception and get a picture of the situation , she promised .	-4.4549
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .	-3.9190
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens postally in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holiday .	-5.3332
The yellow questionnaire is the " Arc of Building and Property " , which deals , among other things , with the construction condition and the rehabilitation intentions .	-5.5284
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Apartment Arc " , information on the size , division and residents of a living room can be provided .	-4.7520
The blue " operating sheet " must only be filled if business premises are operated in the building .	-4.1218
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .	-3.5887
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .	-3.1003
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of grants works according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first grinds first .	-5.1667
It is not possible to ' reserve ' any funding for later periods .	-5.8532
To conclude , photos of the " Places II " project were shown to make the present a " tasty " restoration .	-6.8119
British inventors set themselves a microchip to get home and car with a hand movement .	-3.8938
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his doorstep , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.1748
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and pointer finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-3.7248
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-3.7036
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-1.9926
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all at an additional cost of $ 300 per lock .	-4.4594
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is on the wheel .	-3.7681
The White House ’ s advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands of dollars .	-3.2161
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s figures left to TIME magazine .	-4.0087
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.5977
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence and White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-3.2514
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a fire fighter car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-3.4800
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.5707
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.0034
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at 3 p.m. on July 17 , at 7 a.m. , and stayed until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.1092
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of hours .	-4.7287
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event , while the unit ’ s security personnel remained on the ground during the time .	-4.3971
The records provided by TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .	-4.1802
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-1.9246
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-2.9763
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-2.9769
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the deputy commander replied .	-2.8582
The " Made in America " event was called the official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-10.9822
But official events also have political overtones .	-2.0040
At the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of health reform underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to contain government rules .	-15.0517
The use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . . , . , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.5726
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.3518
But to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .	-3.1965
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential aircraft .	-4.1441
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , " said Lindsay Walters , Deputy Secretary of the White House .	-4.2287
HMX-1 statutes often carry out training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to deposit the US president in the White House with precise centimeters .	-5.4736
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings in the White House .	-2.9615
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official .	-6.6464
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-12.2087
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden on none of the other requirements presented at the event .	-3.1547
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.8363
HMX-1 does not have a budget record for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.4061
According to the US Defense Department ’ s hourly tariffs for the 2017 financial year , the DD-refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour .	-4.3711
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.3384
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .	-2.3403
" Setting taxpayers ' costs on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-9.9753
'These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual funds . '	-10.8573
According to a 2015 RAND study , the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-3.4597
At that time , the former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-3.0766
" The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , " Spicer said .	-2.4705
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , depend on it .	-10.4011
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.3450
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.5018
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he took the seat of a fire-fighter car .	-4.1975
In the White House , Trump talked to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-2.5259
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them ' .	-2.2533
TC BW Neuss Before Capacity	-4.0240
Leader of the second tennis bundesliga comes at the table third Suchsdorfer SV .	-5.9311
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third Suchsdorfer SV .	-3.6497
Despite five matches , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality .	-5.4275
In any case , team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-3.2115
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations .	-2.8182
It is precisely in the back positions that I find the team very good . '	-3.8989
The imports from the high north mainly provide class and stability at the SV Suchsdorf .	-5.2959
" Their Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup .	-2.8487
And they are also strong in double " , says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-2.5921
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-3.0209
You also need a good portion of luck . '	-3.2873
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north is practical .	-3.1268
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier .	-2.2057
If the French who is still active at the Challenger Tournament in the Italian Biella does not join the Bundesliga match , the Czech Liberec Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) will be the first bet in this season .	-6.9663
Hans Podlipnik-Castillo , who was previously undefeated , was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel .	-5.9286
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-3.3641
Following his two victories last Sunday against the Alster Club , Máté Valkusz could come back to the team .	-4.7164
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary , which was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016 , someone from the coach around Marius Zay will fill up the cadre .	-4.6670
How America Damages OMV	-1.6357
Truly happy , Donald Trump did not appear when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-4.0176
" In his haste to enact the law , " Congress wrapped in a few " unconstitutional rules " , he etched .	-4.6758
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels foiled against the US move .	-4.0047
After all , the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.2608
Accordingly worried have since been investors of the domestic OMV , who , together with other European companies , co-finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Electronic Nord Stream 2 .	-5.8561
The drought scenery is huge .	-3.2019
Nevertheless , it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the Oil Group ’ s official statement .	-3.7613
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring sanctions to life by executive order .	-2.9390
Twelve weapons stand for him .	-2.9163
" The press " has looked at which the Group could defend and which could really hurt it .	-3.6599
Narcos season 3 trailers : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be placed at the center of the Netflix hit series .	-4.6779
Despite the second season of Narcos , which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.9418
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show .	-3.4708
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali cartel .	-3.0833
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribes and violent actions .	-2.2285
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.4632
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<unk>a , the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs .	-3.1147
Other new actors are Matias Varela , Michael Stehl-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-2.2170
The third season of Narcos will start on 1 September .	-2.3801
Roll backwards : The city provides 46 kitchen assistance a reverse role .	-3.9928
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself .	-3.2889
With permanent contact for the children and a assignment to the team .	-3.7806
The clock is turned back in the urban nursery centres .	-3.8469
As of September 1 , the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban children ’ s day-care facilities ( Kitas ) .	-6.2082
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Head of the Youth Assistance Department , this is good news : ' We have all been very pleased ' .	-4.4225
Cooking is still out of the house : a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked products cooled .	-5.6486
The city operates 46 nursery centres in the Krefeld area , and in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunch time .	-5.3347
In the last kita year , 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and demand is growing steadily .	-5.0615
" Not only do children who are served 45 hours a week in the kita at noon , " explains Pomeranz .	-5.2296
" The offer also applies to 35-hour care when children stay until 2 p.m. "	-4.0608
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat up the delivered dishes , complement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portion the meal individually , spend the meal , dispose , rinse and clean the kitchen .	-6.4203
" Employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pomeranz .	-3.3975
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the amount of hours .	-4.3067
" The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the kita team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-3.5541
" They are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the management of capital " .	-4.4437
It is also about healthy nutrition and cooking less. . . . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.2291
" Children should help prepare the food " .	-2.9391
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.6922
Even for the children .	-6.1541
" They have a known force in the kita , a person who is familiar with them and not constantly changing people " .	-3.4416
This continuity is important for children .	-1.4280
The cleaning of the kita rooms - also the task of the kitchen staff so far - will be done by special cleaning staff .	-5.6515
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides improving the quality of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical for the city in comparison with the cost of self-government and foreign allocation , it is stated in the press office .	-8.1909
And that even though 46 part-time forces are recruited .	-3.2576
" But these hours are not so heavily affected by around 750 people in the education sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.6000

Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.8302
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-1.9992
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .	-2.6157

Men are trying to rob 13-year-old girls out of age .	-3.2806
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were supposed to have tried to deprive a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .	-3.1516
According to police information , the men spoke to the 13-year-old , who stayed with friends on the Kolping Road , around 14.55 , because they wanted to phone with the girl 's mobile phone .	-5.7154
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends .	-3.2933
One of the perpetrators then tried to grasp the girl ’ s mobile phone and necklace , but this failed .	-5.5074
Without prey , the duo fled .	-1.9668
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-1.9535
The investigations are under way .	-1.5924
GMB investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-1.9636
A trade union wants to check with managers of Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow .	-4.7458
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-2.7081
More than 500 employees work in the plant , which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products .	-3.3137
McVities owner Pladis said that he has invested more than <unk> 5 million in recent years .	-2.3213
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be " experienced first " if their activities changed .	-3.1547
In a letter to the company 's branch director , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called on " to express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being promoted " .	-5.2674
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply .	-3.7380
Generations of families have worked here , and workers are concentrating heavily on the local community and the large area of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.2138
Therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising living costs and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous production presence at McVitie " .	-4.2016
A Pladis spokesperson said : " The Tollcross subsidiary manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will react directly to it , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-5.1986
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-2.9506
We discussed with employees that , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continually review our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-5.1106
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than <unk> 5 million in our Tollcross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.4745
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operations change at the site , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-4.9562
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago ?	-1.6756
The site of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti	-2.5259
Paris Saint-Germain will not slow down in its persecution of Neymar , after making an offer of $ 189 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack ?	-4.7028
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for GBP 89 million last season .	-4.1158
After completion , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world ’ s most paid professional sportsman .	-15.9304
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out , even though a source near the Catalan Executive Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival in Santos in 2013 .	-4.6794
But was the PSG president warned the world of football three years ago about this prospect ?	-9.7388
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.4420
" I 'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.7691
" We respect all clubs .	-1.2458
But if they try to have one of our players signed by themselves , they will have consequences . '	-3.7559
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG Mittelfeldspieler Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-3.8468
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona felt the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-3.8565

Interview : " Domspatzen report relieves Papst-Brother Georg Ratzinger "	-4.6115
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Papst-Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-2.6834
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.7199
The final report on the scandal of abuse at the Cathedral of Regensburg continues to hold discussions .	-4.2222
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are Church " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency , expecting an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the Emeritian Pope Benedict XVI .	-5.2145
It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their misjudgment of what happened at the time .	-4.6291
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised the ' double standards ' of reporting on violence in the Cathedral Paths .	-4.5050
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that they are " shameful and shameful acts " that would have to be punished and prevented in the future , but the " degree of media manipulation " , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the Italian national bioethics committee , is striking .	-5.3156
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " says Scaraffia .	-4.3306
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian radio station : " You like to go to the church and this is a fed " .	-10.5511
She also pointed out that , in her youth , " beats have been a normal pedagogical means " to deal with cheeky children , as I was one , " . .	-11.2301
It would be unfair to apply current standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.5800
Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger has often appeared in connection with reports of abuses .	-4.3935
Unjustly , says author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-4.2590
" I must protect Georg Ratzinger , " Hesemann says , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he evaluates the results of the final report .	-6.9377
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber , a lawyer commissioned by the Regensburg Diocese ?	-11.3092
A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral Patzen were sexually abused " with high plausibility " between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . " " " . " " . " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "	-8.9717
The final report says Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In summary , it can be said that , in many cases , forms of physical and mental violence have been used by Domkapellmeister R. . .	-4.9008
Especially with high emotionality , punishment for the pupils could also be more severe .	-4.4233
However , unlike many other accused , it is nonetheless apparent that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories , despite violence " .	-7.1224
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburg Cathedral Patzen Georg Ratzinger relieves .	-3.9912
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence against patrons at the Cathedral of Regensburg ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-3.8002
On the one hand , many students emphasize his " humanity " .	-2.8274
On the other hand , he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist , who often became handy when a cathedral patz did not perform top performance in musical terms .	-12.2858
How do you view this final report as its biographer ?	-2.5039
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages of a report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it .	-5.9973
He is just eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or cooperation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.7455
The violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of effect .	-4.5328
At best , he can be accused of being too late or of not taking first suggestions seriously enough .	-5.4421
The Cathedral Patzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all the respondents as - literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better .	-4.7701
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also exhibits an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understandable " , as a very good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbonbons and " always surrounded by grapes of children " .	-5.0687
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which has caused rage .	-3.9573
He admitted , deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he was not only cracking with chairs and throwing the keys onto the ground , but also spreading earpieces and pulling too cheeky guys on the hair or ears .	-8.8114
However , in order to save his honour , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s , both parents and teachers .	-11.6756
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-2.7584
Of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.1708
I , too , have experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.7271
In comparison with what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence at pre-school , these are , of course , bagatelles .	-6.4732
One wonders if it is not more related to his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media were plunging into him .	-7.0121
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope .	-2.8418
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-9.9837
In the media , a great deal has been said about the subject of abuse in the Cathedral Patzen of Regensburg in connection with the report .	-5.6477
Will Georg Ratzinger also be burdened with any involvement or co-knowledge regarding sexual abuse in the final report ?	-4.2813
Michael Hesemann : Naturally no .	-2.3673
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the Cathedral Chapel Master .	-2.9768
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.4473
" I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it , " said one of the people concerned , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-5.7331
The real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse was , and still is , that most of the victims remain silent .	-4.0146
If they did not even entrust parents and siblings , it would certainly not be a choral leader who would have been , to some extent , a colleague of the perpetrators .	-5.5059
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger 's role in relation to abuses ?	-4.7820
Michael Hesemann : An interviewed student put it as follows : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-5.0878
I think it is ... also truly absurd to assume that it is precisely him ... Jacks have opened more intrusively , more clearly or also more openly than towards their parents , boarding boarding schools , trust teachers , etc . . . . . . . . . , . . .	-14.0458
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.4352
Thus , the report comes to the very clear result : ' It was not possible to confirm that students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance ' .	-5.9746
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any participation .	-3.9648
In this way , he cannot be accused of not preventing him or of having made him display .	-5.1131
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these reprehensible crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-4.6973
In the media there was much to read about " violent texts " at the Regensburg Cathedral Patzen .	-5.0199
The former Cathedral Mayor Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of ' displays ' .	-4.6052
Do he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.4228
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger .	-4.5309
But that is , in turn , an abuse of the report .	-3.2716
There is a clear separation : between pre-school and the Cathedral 's Gymnasium , between sexual abuse and violence , and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.2028
In addition , the report deals with incidents since 1945 , also from four decades when Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the Cathedral Patriots .	-5.1148
The whole terrible teaching practice , the cases in which boys were harassed and maltrated by sadist teachers and suffered horribly , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where really scandalous conditions had to prevail .	-6.5727
But with them , Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium .	-5.0401
On that , as most witnesses emphasize , the theme " pre-school " was taboo .	-3.2528
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-4.0168
What was different at the Cathedral Patzengymnasium ?	-3.1050
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but there was no sadistic violence .	-9.6955
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories , despite violence ' .	-5.5343
At most , this remains the accusation of having looked away .	-4.7784
Despite all the efforts , however , the report has only been able to define two periods in which it has been reported on pre-school conditions .	-4.5037
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and heard nothing about what happened at a school where he was not acting and responsible ( so the witness ) , and then again around 1993 .	-6.5624
Does Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the conditions ?	-3.8537
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Patzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.5937
In this , he points out to him that " caning punishment will continue to be applied at pre-school " .	-6.6886
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.7542
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when caning penalties were long banned in Bavaria .	-4.7093
Before that they took place in a legal grey zone , as everyone knows .	-3.4551
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been crossed .	-5.5309
Nor can we say that he has always looked away .	-3.6550
That is simply not true .	-1.5010
It was only in 1980 that the caning punishment at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.8371
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to the time they were at that time .	-9.6835
How do you see this ?	-1.7207
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " pitfalls of anachronism " , i.e. the danger of evaluating past by today 's moral standards .	-4.7206
The Prince is right .	-2.2387
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was abhorrent at all times , nor to what was broken in the pre-school of resistance and violence to innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond the usual one at that time .	-7.3032
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being dealt with .	-4.0293
At the same time , however , I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-8.1247
His means of disciplining and punishing , i.e. pulling slaps and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970 ’ s . . to . .	-11.1227
When physical punishment was then banned , he also adhered strictly to it .	-3.7369
What picture of his Regensburg period has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the discussions with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-4.2826
Has the subject of caning also been raised ?	-4.0368
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict 's XVI , tells from his perspective , since the Cathedral Patches played only a side role .	-5.0377
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-3.9842
But this must also be said : without this perfectionism , without calling for unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world class from the previously more nationally known Regensburg Cathedral Patzen , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which would have toured twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-7.3916
With biscuits and bonbons alone , one does not make recalcitrant boys a big singer and face every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-6.5632
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-4.0413
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have repeatedly experienced as wonderful , humorous , grassy , deeply believing and heartfelt people , who cannot be imagined to suffer even a fly .	-6.5637
I regularly get to know how many former Cathedral Patzen still keep in touch with him 23 years after his emergence , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .	-5.9311
Those who still do not forgive him that he was strictly with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.5303
Most of the cathedral treasures are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music .	-4.5351
And that he has always been a good , fatherful teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a loving respectful sperson to whom they are still watching and worshipping today .	-7.7541
And , once again , I would like to make it quite clear that everything that is accused of is educational methods that were the order of the day .	-6.5730
We can be glad that we have long overcome this period .	-2.6931
But it is highly unfair to make a man a scapegoat simply because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother .	-3.2282
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious .	-2.5657
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.2013
Now the decency would command a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit and without whom no one outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany would know the Cathedral Patzen of Regensburg would finally be in peace .	-7.2265
