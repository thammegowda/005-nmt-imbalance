A very sad incident occurred in Maloya village, which is located on the outskirts of the city, where a newly married woman committed suicide by hanging herself from the fan.
Komal had married only two months ago.
A police investigation found that Komal was worried about her financial situation and so she took this step.
According to the description, the details of the death of Komal only came to light when one of Komal's cousin went to the third floor of their house to do some cleaning.
Seeing the body hanging from the fan the girl screamed and immediately informed the in-laws about it.
Komal was immediately taken to the Multi-speciality Government Hospital, Sector-16, where she was declared dead on arrival.
Komal's husband Kulvinder is unemployed.
Before committing suicide, Komal wrote with henna on her left hand that she was committing suicide of her own free will as the difficulties in her life were too much for her.
According to the details received, Komal's father had passed away a few years ago, her mother is mentally ill and her brother is studying in a government school.

It is a known fact that theft is on the rise in the city these days.
This is the seventh incident in the past few days.
All those renewal renewed and valid driving licenses (DL) are ready where photos are donewere submitted by till up to the 30th of September, The rest will be provided by next week.
This notice has been placed on the DTO office delivery counter.
It is clear that the DTO office itself accepts that DLs are being delivered after one month, while the service act specifies that the deadline is seven days.
This means that within seven days of application the DTO office has to give the finished DL to the applicant.
If we talk about the reality on the ground then the situation is even worse.
There are very many applicants to whom the DL has not been delivered even after 1 month.
The number of applicants who are being moved around the office for two to three months are countless.
You can get an idea of how bad the situation is in the office from the fact that DTO Anil Garg does not have any information regarding the notice on the delivery counter.
He claims that DLs are being delivered within the given deadline.
When asked why the notice has been displayed he replied that he did not have any information regarding this.

This fact was revealed after the investigation by the Environment Protection Board.
The investigation that was conducted last year at different places, during Diwali, showed that the noise pollution reached a level of 100 decibels.
On an ordinary day it is usually 55 decibels.
Every year the noise pollution level increases due to the noise of the firecrackers or loud DJ music.
Even after the restrictions imposed by the government people are continuing to sell and buy high decibel crackers openly.
The management and prevention of the above activities is the responsibility of the local S.D.M, but they avoid this responsibility even when needed.
The Environment Protection Board had measured the noise pollution near the traffic police station last year during Diwali.
The investigation was done before Diwali on the 10th of November at different times.
The minimum noise level was found to be 72.5 decibels and the maximum 83.6 decibels.
Similarly, during Diwali, on the 13th of November 2013, the maximum sound level was 87.7 decibels and the minimum was 80 decibels.
During Diwali a maximum of 100.3 decibels of noise pollution was recorded and the minimum was 72.1 decibels.
On an ordinary day the maximum level of noise pollution recorded was 65 decibels, while the minimum was found to be 55 decibels.
Unfortunately, people don't care about the level of increased noise pollution and continue to buy high decibel firecrackers.

Demand for gold bars and coins went down due to inflation and the weak economic situation and this has reduced its attraction.
In Delhi, gold was priced at 31,400 Rs. per 10 grams. It was 32,485 Rs. per 10 grams last year during Dhanteras.
Haresh Soni, the Chairman of All India Gems and the Jewellery Federation said,"Due to the weak economic situation and inflation the demand for gold has gone down drastically".
Mehul Chowksi, Chairman and MD of the Gitanjali Group, said that the sale of gold had gone down by 25 percent.
The attitude of buyers has changed.
We are expecting the sales of diamonds to go up by 25 percent this year.
Compared to last year gold prices have gone down this year, but the customers still preferred to buy silver this Dhanteras.
The chief of the PSS organises meetings arbitrarily.
Ramprasad Yadav, the PSS from Bengabad, has made the allegation and demanded Panchayat Raj officers relieve the Chief of his duties and that action is taken against the Secretary.
He said that on the 4th of July he had complained about the Secretary and the Chief and as a result the Chief suspended him.
He has provided proof of irregularities committed by the Chief to the Panchayat Raj officers.
He said that the general meeting of the PSS was called with 7 day notice, but information of the meeting held on May 12th was sent on May 8th, which reached the PSS a day before the meeting.
Information about the PSS meeting, which was held on July 3rd, was not given to the Panchayat level committee officer, so they could not attend the meeting.
He alleged that it was a requirement of the Act to send a summary of meeting minutes to each member but this is not done.
At the July 3rd meeting, the Chief made the decision, in their own private office, to spend the 13th finance commission fund.
While demanding an investigation into this matter, he has requested that the expenditure of 13th finance commission fund is halted.
Our Jagran correspondent, Jammu: When evil arises on earth and evil people torture innocent people then God has to incarnate to exterminate the evil ones.
To free the people of Mathura from the atrocities of Kansa, Lord Krishna was born.
Mahanta Nand Kishore (from Gau Manasa) narrated the story of the incarnation of Lord Krishna to people on the Indo-Pakistani border in Laleyal Satwari on Thursday during Shrimad Bhagwat week, with the desire for peace.
He said that Lord Krishna redressed the grievances of the people by killing the horrible monsters in his childhood.
Mahanta said that you should not allow inferiority to enter your mind and devote your mind to God.
The mere remembrance of God keeps the sufferings of human beings at bay.
He said that it is the feelings of inferiority Pakistan has, when compared to India, that forces them to move down the wrong path again and again.
They must understand that with every such act they are hurting innocent people living on both sides of the border.
Before this Katha hundreds of pilgrims offered oblations to the Havan that is being organised for the desire for peace on the border.
Hundreds of pilgrims are visiting to take the Raspan of Havan and Shrimadkatha.
Nayab Sarpanch of Laleyal Satwari, Chain Singh said that a Langar has also been organised for the pilgrims visiting this place.
The Katha will be completed and the final oblation to the Havan will be made on Saturday.
Office correspondent, Rupnagar: With the aim of spreading awareness among the public against corruption the Roop-nagar vigilance unit held a seminar at a local Khalsa school.
The general public also participated in it along with students and teachers.
The DSP of the Roop-nagar vigilance bureau, Balveer Singh said, if the general public were vigilant against corruption then a corruption free society could be built.
While motivating people Balveer Singh said that if any official or member of staff asked for a bribe for any work, a complaint could be sent to the vigilance department.
The department would give punishment that officials or staff members fearlessly and to the full extent of the law.
Succha Singh, Sarsa Nangal, Amarjeet Singh Bhullar and Vigilance inspector Pal Singh addressed the seminar.
They said that at the present time corruption had emerged as a major problem.
Every member of society had to come forward to have complete control over it, because corruption now has roots that are so deep that it is no longer possible for the government acting alone to uncover it and stop it.
For this reason the general public has to come forward.
Gifts and sweets were distributed among the students and teachers by the organisers of this program.
The Organizing Committee President, Baba Ranjit Singh Thakur, said that Diwali is a Festival of Joy and Happiness.
The people of Ayodhya had lit strings of lamps to welcome Lord Rama on his return from exile.
The tradition of celebrating this festival started at that time.
He appealed to the students to take inspiration from the life of Lord Sri Rama.
Bal Krushna Thakur, Rameshchandra Thakur, Umadutta Gautam and Ramesh Thakur were also present at this event.
Halloween was celebrated all over the world, on October 31st.
Many western countries believe that it is very important to keep their ancestors' souls happy because, if these souls get upset, they might cause harm.
So, they celebrate this day.
At Halloween parties they can be seen wearing very unusual costumes.
Not only this, but in many places people organize Halloween parties, where people arrive in many scary and weird costumes.
At a single Halloween party one can see many weird faces.
Some of these are really scary, while others are very funny.
A fire at a fireworks shop in Dehradun road has caused quite a stir.
Thankfully, the fire was brought under control on time.
On the Dehradun road, near the Durga Temple, Umesh Singh had set up a fireworks shop outside his hotel.
At about 8:30 PM a rocket suddenly landed on the fireworks counter.
Within no time the fireworks counter was engulfed in flames and the entire shop was burnt down amidst the explosions of fireworks.
Customers were in the shop at the time.
The owner of the shop tried to extinguish the fire using fire extinguishers and sand.
Meanwhile, the fire brigade also arrived.
No one was injured in the accident.
The fire in the fireworks shop caused quite a stir among the locals.
The fire brigade officer, Dani Ram, said the fire was brought under control in time.
Following the incident the shopkeepers in the market have been sternly requested to take all necessary safety precautions.
Apart from the cinemas of South India, her films also make a big impact in the cinemas halls in Singapore and Malaysia.
The name of the actress is "Avni Modi".
Avni is from the Gandhinagar district of Gujrat.
Avni was interested in acting from childhood, but until college she wasn't able to brush up her acting skills.
Because of this, her college script writer even once told her to,"forget about acting, as you don't even understand the A in Acting".
She was lost in the crowd of her school and college, but now she is making Gujarat very famous in the Tamil Film Industry.
However, on the arrival of the landlord, it was revealed that the girl is his relative.
The family members went to the market so they left the girl at home and locked the door.
The girl has been handed over to the family in the presence of a councillor and the police.
The relative of Sushil Vishwakarma, Soni Devi's 14 years old daughter, came from Giridiha to his home.
Soni's husband is deceased.
Sushil's wife Anjali went to the market on Friday, keeping the girl locked up at home.
Here, the girl started crying.
The people of the community rushed to the spot.
People around the house immediately reported the matter to the police.
Councillor Anup Sav arrived.
Anjali had also arrived by that time.
She said that this girl was her relative.
As her family's situation is not so good, we are taking care of her.
Her mother, Sunita Devi a.k.a. Soni, and her family live in Belatandh village in Giridih.
Her father Mantu Vishwakarma is deceased.

Her mother said that they sent their daughter to her relative, Sushil Vishwakarma and his wife Anjali.
In the presence of the councillor and the police, Soni Devi took her daughter from her relative's place.
Anjali said, "We cannot keep the girl with us".
If anything had gone wrong we would have been helpless.
The taxi driver was injured in the incidence.
He has been admitted to Sundernagar civil hospital.
Both his legs are fractured.
Police have charged the taxi driver with careless driving and have started an investigation.
After a post-mortem at the Sundernagar civil hospital, the body was handed over to the relatives.
In the early morning at about quarter to three, when the taxi reached Chatrokhadi in Sundernagar, the driver suddenly dozed off.
Because of this the speeding taxi collided with a eucalyptus tree which was on the edge of the highway.
The passenger Ganga Devi and the driver, Chandra Kiran the son of Subhash Chand a resident of Syal (Manali), were badly injured.
On hearing the sound of a car colliding with a tree, the near-by residents came to the scene and immediately informed the police.
The police were able to remove Ganga and Chandra Kiran from the damaged car with some difficulty and took them to the Sundernagar civil hospital.
Ganga Devi was declared dead by doctors.
Ganga was going to meet her sister in Mumbai, and so she was heading to Chandigarh to catch a flight later that afternoon.
This case is being handled by Sub-Inspector Surendra Kumar.
D.S.P. Kulbhushan Varma confirmed this tragedy.
In the raiding team, ADCP City II Amreek Singh Pawar, ACP west Dilbagh Singh, M.H.O Cant Iqbal Singh and more than one hundred other police officers were present.
The search lasted up to three hours in the jail, but the police did not find any narcotics or mobile phones.

Announcement of the candidates for the three seats has been posted.
Candidates from Cant, North-Central, East, Paatan-Majhauli and Bargi Assembly seats have been declared in the list issued by the party.
The Bhartiya Janata Party has announced their candidates for the 147 Assembly seats on Thursday.
The list has only those names which were speculated about earlier.
As per the list issued by the BJP, Ishwardas Rohani from Cant, Sharad Jain from the North-Centre, Aanchal Sonkar from the East, Ajay Vishnoi from Paatan- Majhauli and Pratibha Singh from Bargi have been included.
The list prepared by the BJP included the candidates who were already chosen except for the North-Centre and Bargi assembly, where the talks to change the candidates went on for a long time.
Except for the East Assembly seat, candidates from the other seats are sitting MLAs of their respective seats.
Only Anchal Sonkar was already a former member of the Eastern Assembly for the east constituency.
After this declaration of candidates, workers celebrated in their areas.
The decision regarding the rest of the candidates for the Assembly would only be made after Diwali.
According to the sources, Assembly seats where there is some opposition or problems due to caste, new candidates can be finalised.
Around 276 party workers will go to Delhi on Friday with a demand to give a ticket to a local candidate for the Assembly.
All these party workers will meet the national president Rajnath Singh, the organization secretary Ramlal, former president Nitin Gadkari, Ananth Kumar, incharge of M.P and the president of the national youth wing, Anurag Thakur.
However, officers have not said anything about finding any rock in the excavation.
Shobhan Sarkar has said that the rock has been found and as soon as it is broken up the SSI officers will find out the truth about the treasure.
Shobhan Sarkar lost his temper many times while talking to the media and also altered his statements.
Once he said that if this operation was being undertaken by the army, the truth would have been known already.
At the same time he said, and shocked everyone by saying, that until he is called to the excavation site the gold will not be found.
When asked about the differences in his comments he became annoyed and started accusing the Government and the SSI, talking about what exactly is being done at the excavation site and that the media is being banned from entry there.
We had demanded a live telecast of the excavation.
However, he did agree that the SSI excavation team is digging on the right spot, as he had indicated.
Meanwhile, after a day's rest the SSI team has started digging again today but could not make even a centimetre of progress.
The Assistant District Collector, Vijay Shankar Dubey, said that today the SSI team kept cleaning the area excavated so far, 4.80 m., the whole day.
If the Tata Workers Union is not able to provide any permanent solution to the Tata Steel Employees quarter extension issue, then the secretary-general would have to fix a date for a quick requisition meeting.
If the decision on a grade revision is taking time, then efforts shall be made to provide these employees with some interim amount.
With these two demands, around ten union members met the General Secretary B.K Dinda on Friday evening and put forward a proposal.
While speaking, Dinda mentioned that on Friday the issue of the extension could not be discussed between the Management and the Union.
An Office Bearer meeting would be held on Saturday, at which this issue would be discussed.
Among the people who went to meet the General Secretary were Ghulam Moinuddin, Manjit Singh, Saroj Pandey, Mahendra Singh, Dharmendra Upadhyay, Lal Bahadur Upadhyay, Ravi Shankar Pandey, Munneshwar Pandey and Girish.
The Corporate Services Deputy V.P. was in the city but could not meet the Union officers.
This issue would probably now be discussed on Monday.
All the committee members, as well as the employees, met the office holders and informed them of their problems.
No circular was published with information on the date of application for the submission map, which in turn created some confusion among the workers.
The festival of lights, Diwali began today.
Dhanteras or Small Diwali is on Friday.
As well as Diwali house decorations, beautiful rangolis are also an attraction.
Beautiful rangolis in the front yards or courtyards of houses are making the houses more beautiful.
We have chosen some pictures from Gujarat on this occasion.
By making these beautiful rangolis you can also make your house beautiful.
These officers had already been promoted to the grade of Joint Secretary and their current designations were upgraded to Joint Secretary levels.
Deepak Varma and others from the Nangal district had filed a petition in the High Court against the increase in fees. Advocate Dhiraj Chawla stated that the notice from the High Court had been received from the B.B.M.B advocate Kuldeep Tiwari.
The reply date for the notice is fixed for the 12th of November.
It should be noted that it was only last month that B.B.M.B had increased the fees after two years, for non B.B.M.B students.
Because of this, the parents approached the High Court.
Two years ago, when the fees were increased, the parents protested on the streets against this and only after that were the fees reduced a bit.
Parents were angry when the fees were increased once again.
Parents are shocked by the sudden revision of fees, after just 5 months of the new term.
After the meetings, parents demonstrated against the steps taken by the school.
Despite this, the school did not respond and finally the parents had to go to the High Court.
The parents said that the frequent revision of fees is not fair.
This not only affects the children's education but also affects the parents' businesses.
The chief said that developmental work should be carried in keeping with transparency in the government work.
He said no irregularities will be tolerated in the implementation of schemes.
Earlier the Block Co-operative Officer was instructed to provide a list of bills provided to all panchayats, a list of the Srividhi farmers under the Green Revolution Scheme, as well as a detailed pack of information of the amount received under this scheme.
In the meeting the order was given that the para teachers would not be engaged in the work of building construction.
The BEEO was asked to provide a list of the schools under construction in the block.
Representatives who had come to attend the meeting in the absence of the Health department and the CDPO were not allowed to sit in the meeting hall.
It was the decision of the house that departmental representatives were attending the meeting just to complete the quorum and were not equipped with complete information.
Many departments including those for supply, drinking water, cleaning and health were reviewed in this meeting.
In this meeting the parliamentary representative, Prof. Pravin Chaudhari, said that the Cooperative Department should provide the funds for the Green Revolution beneficiaries so that the farmers can move ahead.
He gave emphasis to the high level investigation of the activities of the Co-operative department.
It is written in Hitler's Autobiography "Mein Kampf" that the size of the lie is the main reason for trust.
People accept the bigger lie more easily than the smaller lie due to the primitive simplicity of their brains.
During the emergency Congress leader Devant Baruah used the slogan "Indira is India".
But the historical facts are different.
There is a glorious history of nation building.
The people of India have made the country world renowned with their active efforts.
Philosophy and culture, the Vedic sages Kapil, Buddha, Mahavira and Shankara are such notable ancestors.
Dynasties such as Chandragupta Mauraya, Ashoka etc.,are examples of ancient national unity.
There is a long list of iconic men who fought against foreign armed attacks and rulers.
Vivekananda, Dayanand, Tilak, Gandhi, Subhash, Patel, Lohia, Bipin Chandra, Ambedkar etc., and Bhagat Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad make a long list of immortal martyrs, but Congress has only been giving credit for nation building to the Nehru - Gandhi family.
The bigger lie is the more effective.
Out of the 58 central schemes 16 have Rajiv Gandhi's name on them.
The list of other schemes, awards, airports and institutions with the Nehru family name attached to them is long.
Now preparations are being made to name even the Public Distribution System i.e., the PDS scheme, after Indira Gandhi.
The names of such iconic men have been inspiring.
Naming streets, universities or airports after them is welcome, but to name the rural housing scheme of the national capital's international airport is not acceptable under any circumstances.
The public distribution system has already been brought into disrepute.
Who is stopping the Congress from asking for votes in the name of this scheme?
But what is the problem in looking beyond the Nehru family, when it comes to naming?
Many competing arguments were exchanged between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the main opposition party prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, about the greatness of Sardar Patel.
Patel is a great nation builder.
He joined 562 states into one nation.
Patel belongs to everyone, he is loved by the whole of India, but Congress has made him their own property.
The public distribution system may be named after Patel too.
This will not affect the importance of Patel in any way.
Congress has been in power for a long time.
The politicisation of the schemes was done by Congress itself.
Congress was once a democratic party, with democratic leaders like Tilak, Gokhale, Gandhi, Subhash, Rajendra Prasad, Nehru, Patel and Madan Mohan Malviya. Since 1950, it has come under a single family's control.
Party and Family have become synonymous.
To proclaim family and country synonymous the slogan 'Indira is India' was created.
The naming of the schemes has also become a household matter.
Government schemes are run from the accumulated exchequer, from the country's taxpayers.
The nation's exchequer is not the property of any single family in Congress.
Following the example of Congress each party created their own icons.
The regional parties ran schemes in the names of politicians as they wish.
Everyone has icons, but the list of party icons kept increasing.
Currently, every small or large party has its own icon.
Government schemes are not run in the names of political leaders in America.
Their justification in India is pathetic.
The centre plans to take the credit for all the schemes by running the schemes in the names of the Nehru family.
Schemes in the names of Mahatma Gandhi, Patel, Subhash Chandra Bose or Bhagat Singh's cannot be identified with the identity of Congress.
Congress has moved away from its heritage.
Only preaching or messages from Rahul-Sonia seem to work for Congress.
Of course the other parties also name their schemes the same way, but they do not stick to one family's name for every scheme.
The politicization of social welfare schemes is condemnable.
The laptops distributed in Uttar Pradesh have the picture of the SP chief on them.
Of course, the voters give the majority winning party the right to make policies.
The government is bound to the planning and implementation of their duties, but the taxpayers and voters definitely do not give the government the right to name the schemes as they wish.
Voters expect governance from the government not politics, and taxpayers expect the proper transparent use of the exchequer.
The misuse of the exchequer is a constitutional offence.
Some kind of naming protocol has to be developed.
Political leaders are not the solution to everything.
India is full of multi-talented geniuses.
The names of the institutes of higher education / research institutions must named after talented Indian scientists.
A philosopher's name or a distinguished author's name will be appreciated for literature, philosophy or the art institutes.
There is a lack of a sense of history in politics.
There was also a long debate on naming the country in the constituent assembly.
Seth Govinddas, Kamalapati Tripathy put forward 'Bharat'.
The name Bharat received 38 votes and India received 51.
The fundamental question is: why is no serious thought given to the naming of the schemes?
Why is politics always involved in this?
Why is such importance given to one single family?
Why not make a list of common public approved names?
Joint committees of Parliament and the legislature may also be used to create a list.
Why is there gross negligence at both the national and state levels in naming the schemes?
Due to this negligence, the young generation is forgetting the names of our freedom fighters.
There are different types of heroes.
Some are created by TV and mostly are biased with political prejudice.
Naming is a cognitive exercise.
In the "Jnyansukta " of the Rigveda, naming has been called the beginning of knowledge.
Naming the schemes well can be inspirational.
Memorising names of great people from general knowledge books is an act of labour, but naming the government schemes, streets or important places after inspiring personalities is the easiest tool for reviving a the sense of history.
Names like Gandhi Nagar, Patel Airport, Ambedkarpuram or Vivekanandapuram add an historicalinspiration.
In a recent survey conducted just two to three months ago, it was shown that half of the country's villages and cities are associated with the name of Rama.
Extra vigilance is required in naming the country, period, culture, civilisation and history.
Their names become representative of specific expressions and approaches.
Dayananda, Vivekananda and Gandhi's names are synonyms with social reform, Vedic philosophy truth and non-violence, respectively
The Friends of Congress are requested to overcome their addiction of looking for names from the same family.
There are many names in Indian history with a golden glow.
The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Tribunal has ordered that Rs.50.67 lakhs compensation should be paid to the family of the former Minister of Maharashtra, Shrikant Jichkar, who was killed in a road accident in 2004.
The family had demanded Rs. 25.82 crores.
The family had said that the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation [MSRTC] bus driver's negligence caused the death of Jichkar on the 2nd of June 2004.
Along with ordering the MSRTC to pay the compensation the Tribunal said that the insurance company should not pay anything as the car belonged to Jichkar himself.
The family of Shriram Dhavadh, Jichkar's lecturer friend's family, will also receive compensation of Rs 21.60 lakh.
He also died in the same accident.
Out of this, approximately 70 percent of the amount (Rs.15.12 lakhs) will be paid by the MSRTC.
The driver of Jichkar's car was also found guilty of negligence and hence the remaining 30 percent (Rs. 6.48 lakhs) will be paid by the former minister's family.
During this time they discussed the combined activities of the party supporters and the members.
The Gojmumo organizational Committee Chairman, Tilak Gurung, said that the Gojmumo Head met the temporary employee organization, the permanent employee organization and Bhutia and Tibetan members of the organization on Thursday to discuss various issues.
The people of Twin City may celebrate Diwali in the dark in this season.
Those who have not paid their electricity bill within the due date.
Disconnection is being done 15 days after the due date.
Hundreds of connections from subdivisions number one and two from the Cant and Babyal substations have been disconnected.
Because of this, the crowd of disconnected consumers is increasing at electricity offices.
Consumers are disturbed.
One of the problems is that the Power corporation is not accepting part-payments.
The Corporation is accepting 80 to 90% payment of the bill, as part-payment.
